We\u2019ll then respond\nto you (and your vet if submitted on your behalf) in writing\nwith the outcome. A pre-approval isn\u2019t valid unless we\u2019ve\nagreed to it in writing.\nNote: If we agree to a pre-approval but the treatment\nprovided by your vet differs from the treatment request in\nthe pre-approval, then our assessment of the amount we\ncover under your claim may vary from the notified pre-\napproval amount. A variation in the amount we cover may\nalso occur if you have reached your benefit limit, sub-limit\nor other applicable limit on the claim.\nand calculates your pet insurance claim benefits while you\u2019re\nstill at the vet. If your vet is GapOnly\u00ae enabled, you don\u2019t\nneed to pay your vet in full prior to the submission of your\nclaim. Instead, your vet submits the claim to us electronically\non your behalf and you agree to pay the \u2018gap\u2019 (the difference\nbetween the vet\u2019s invoice and the claim benefit calculated, if\nany, under your policy).\nYou must pay the gap to your treating vet at the time you\nmake a GapOnly\u00ae claim. We\u2019ll then pay the claim benefit (if\nany) directly to your vet.\nYou can find more information on GapOnly\u00ae here: www.\ngaponly.com.au.\nGapOnly\u00ae claim, we\u2019ll pay the claim benefits to you, not your\nvet.\n24\nYou agree that we\u2019re authorised to discuss with your vet, the\ndetails relating to your claim or the treatment provided to\nyour pet in relation to a claim made under your policy. You\nalso agree that your vet is authorised to view the outcome\nof your claim, including the amount of claims benefits.\nPlease note that:\n\u2022 in some instances, we may require more information to\nprocess your claim, such as previous medical history or\npathology/laboratory results. We\u2019ll contact you or your\nvet if required;\n\u2022 there may be situations where we request additional\nveterinary history from current or previous vets, e.g. if\nthere\u2019s a large history gap, to ensure we have all relevant\nclinical information for your pet;\n\u2022 for adopted pets, veterinary history is only required from\nwhen you took ownership. You\u2019ll need to provide us with\nproof of adoption or transfer of ownership papers;\n\u2022 if you\u2019re making an emergency boarding claim, we may\nrequire supporting documentation;\n\u2022 unless we agree otherwise, all of your claims must\ninclude itemised tax invoice(s), payment receipt(s) and\nvet consultation notes if applicable;\n\u2022 incomplete claim forms may result in a processing\ndelay. We recommend that you retain copies of all\ndocumentation for your records;\n\u2022 you also agree that your current or previous vet or any\nother service provider that provided treatments to your\npet is authorised to release information and/or records\nto us about your pet; and\n\u2022 you\u2019re responsible for any fees and expenses that may\nbe charged to you by any third parties relating to the\npurchase and administration of your policy, assistance\nprovided to you to complete any forms and in relation to\nclaims.\nAdjustment of claim payments\nIf the vet expenses incurred by you exceed what is\nreasonable and essential, having regard to other vet\nexpenses in a similar situation, your claim payments may be\nadjusted and paid based on the reasonable and essential\ntreatment or fees typically charged for the treatment, for a\npet in similar circumstances.\n25\nSettlement of your claim\nWe\u2019ll send you a remittance advice regarding the settlement\nof your claim, either by email or letter, depending on your\nchosen means to communicate with us. This advice provides\ndetails of your claim outcome and how your claim has been\nprocessed. For Hollard issued policies, all approved benefits\nwill be paid into your nominated bank account or by cheque.\nFor PetSure issued policies, we\u2019ll pay all approved benefits\ninto your nominated bank account.\nWe reserve the right to deduct from the benefit amount any\namount due to us, for example for any overdue premium\npayments.\nNote: In the event that we pay a benefit contrary to the\npolicy terms and conditions for whatever reason, this won\u2019t\nconstitute a waiver of our rights to apply the policy terms\nand conditions retrospectively to any paid claims or to any\nfuture claims for that or any related condition.\nWe also reserve our right to recover from you any benefit\namount received by you as a result of such error.\nDeclining to process your claim\nIf you or your vet refuse to or are unable to provide\ninformation reasonably requested by us to process your\nclaim, we may decline or reduce the amount payable for\nyour claim, in accordance with relevant law.\nFraudulent claims\nIf you submit a fraudulent claim or entice your vet to behave\nin a fraudulent manner regarding a claim, then the claim may\nbe denied or reduced in accordance with relevant law, and\nwe may cancel your policy altogether in the event you make\na fraudulent claim.

Total\nbenefits paid to you across all insurance cannot exceed your\nactual expenses.\nHow we prevent or handle fraud\nUnfortunately, fraud and attempted fraud can occur. We\nemploy sophisticated fraud detection and prevention\ntechniques to ensure we only pay genuine claims. By doing\nthis we\u2019re protecting you and all our policyholders.\nYou must not act in a fraudulent manner. If you or anyone\nacting for you:\n\u2022 makes a claim, submits a document, or makes a\nstatement in support of a claim under the policy\nknowing the claim, document or statement to be false or\nfraudulently exaggerated in any respect;\n\u2022 works with your vet to behave in a fraudulent manner\nregarding a claim, e.g. pressuring your vet to note\nincorrect information; or\n\u2022 makes a claim in respect of any loss or damage caused\nby your willful act or by colluding with another person;\nThen:\n\u2022 we may be entitled to refuse to pay all or part of the\nclaim, to the extent permitted by law;\n\u2022 we may cancel your policy and any other insurance\npolicies you hold with us;\n\u2022 we may be entitled to reclaim any payments already\nmade to you in respect of such claims;\n\u2022 we may not refund a premium already paid; or\n\u2022 we may inform the police of the circumstances and we\nmay take legal action.\n28\n6\nPAYING YOUR\nPREMIUM\nYour insurance policy cover is provided on the basis that\nyou\u2019ve paid or agreed to pay us the premium for that\ncover. The amount you pay is shown on your certificate of\ninsurance. It includes all premium, administration fees and\nany applicable discounts, government taxes, fees and/or\ncharges.\nWe like to think we don\u2019t miss a thing, but if you have a\nquestion about anything on your certificate of insurance,\nplease contact us.\nHow to pay\nYour pet insurance premium is payable when you take out a\nnew policy and subsequently when your policy is renewed.\nPremiums can be paid via direct debit through a credit card\nor bank account:\n\u2022 annually;\nOR\n\u2022 in monthly or fortnightly instalments.\nWhen premiums are paid in monthly or fortnightly\ninstalments, you\u2019ll be charged a collection fee per instalment,\nthe amount of which will be displayed on your certificate of\ninsurance.\nIf we accept and pay a claim under your policy, we may\ndeduct the balance of any outstanding premium from the\nclaim payment.\nPaying on time\nYou need to make sure your premium payment(s) are up to\ndate.

Should this second attempt fail, we\u2019ll\ntry again after 14 calendar days and, depending on your\npayment frequency, we\u2019ll deduct either the outstanding\namount, or the outstanding amount together with your\nregular instalment.\nIf you\u2019d like to make a real-time payment of your\noutstanding balance before we reattempt a direct debit, just\ncall us to do this.\nFor payments by direct debit\nFor Hollard issued policies, if the direct debit bank account is\nnot yours, you confirm you have the authority of the account\nholder to use it and that they\u2019ve agreed to these terms.\nFor PetSure issued policies, you must have the sole authority\nas the account holder of the direct debit bank account and\nagree to the Direct Debit Request Service Agreement.\nFor payments by credit card\nIf the credit card is not yours, you confirm you have the\nauthority of the credit card account holder to use it and that\nthey\u2019ve agreed to these terms.\nShould you have questions about the operation of the direct\ndebit authority or you need to change any aspects of the\nauthority, please contact us.\n31\n7\nRENEWALS,\nCANCELLATIONS\n& CHANGES\nThis part of the booklet explains your options for renewing,\ncancelling or changing the cover for your pet insurance\npolicy.\nAnnual renewal of your insurance policy\nAs long as we continue to provide the product, we\u2019ll offer\nrenewal of your policy every year.

It is very important that you do so, as we base\nour decision whether to provide cover and the terms on\nwhich we do so on your answers.\n35\nIf you\u2019re not sure of the answers to any of our questions,\nyou should take the time to find them. It\u2019s also important\nto understand that, in answering the questions, you\u2019re\nanswering for yourself and anyone else to whom the\nquestions apply.\nIf any of our questions aren\u2019t clear and you need help, please\ncontact us.\nWhen this duty applies\nThe duty to take reasonable care not to make a\nmisrepresentation also applies before you renew, vary,\nextend or reinstate an existing contract of insurance. This\nmeans that you must inform us of any changes to the\ninformation set out in your certificate of insurance, where the\ninformation is no longer honest, accurate and complete. If\nyou don\u2019t contact us to update this information, we\u2019ll take it\nthat you agree that the information remains honest, accurate\nand complete. Please contact us if you have any doubts.\nIf you don\u2019t comply with your duty\nIf you don\u2019t take reasonable care in answering our questions\nor inform us of changes to the information set out in\nyour policy documents, you may breach your duty. If that\nhappens, your policy may be cancelled, or treated as if it\nnever existed, and any claim may be denied or not paid in\nfull.\nUpdates to the PDS\nWe may need to update this PDS from time to time when\ncertain changes occur and where we\u2019re required and\npermitted by law to do so. If that happens, we\u2019ll issue you\nwith a new PDS or a Supplementary PDS or other compliant\ndocument to update the relevant information.\nWhere the information isn\u2019t materially adverse from the\npoint of view of a reasonable person considering whether\nto buy or continue to hold this insurance, we may issue you\nwith notice in a different form, including but not limited to\ndisclosure updates on the PetSure and/or\nPetinsurance.com.au website(s).\nYou can contact us to get a free paper copy or download an\nelectronic copy that summarises these changes.\n36\nHow we calculate your premium\nYour premium is calculated when your Petinsurance.com.au\npolicy begins, at each policy anniversary, and also if you vary\nyour cover. The premium for each policy period is printed on\nyour certificate of insurance.\nThe amount you pay also includes allowances for\ngovernment fees, taxes and charges, including stamp duty\nand GST.\nFor new policies\nWe calculate your premium based on several factors. Some\nare pre-set and don\u2019t vary, e.g. amounts we consider for\nsome internal expenses. Others can affect the premium\namount depending on whether we believe it increases or\ndecreases the risk to us. For example, the type of cover and\noptions you have selected.\nWe\u2019ll also take into account risk factors associated with\nyou and your pet such as your pet\u2019s breed and age. For\ninstance, as your pet gets older the risk of your pet requiring\ntreatment will increase and so the premium increases.\nThere are also commercial factors that affect your premium,\nincluding costs associated with operating our business and\nour commercial arrangements.\nYour premium calculation may also include discounts or\npromotional offers that we provide. If you qualify for two or\nmore discounts, we apply a specific order to our calculation\nof your final premium.\nAlso, any discounts and/or your premium may be rounded\nup or down and some may only apply in the first year of\ncoverage.\nFor renewals and changes to your policy\nFor renewals, we also factor in the claim history for your pet\nand the average cost of care for pets like yours, as well as\nthe claims experience across all our insured pets. Because of\nall of these factors and the changes to your pet\u2019s risk profile,\nyour premium will increase from year to year.\nWhen calculating your premium on renewal, we also\nconsider how much your premium was previously, including\nany discounts that may have been applied. This means that\nwe may limit movements up or down.\n37\nThese same factors and others are also used to calculate\nyour premium if you amend your coverage.\nFor information about how and when to pay your premium,\nplease read the \u201cPaying your premium\u201d section.\nCooling off period\nYou have a 30 day period to ensure you\u2019re happy with every\naspect of your policy.\nDuring this time, you can contact us and cancel your policy.\nIf we receive your request to cancel your policy within the\n30 day period after the policy commencement date or\nrenewal date and as long as you\u2019ve not made a claim or\nintend to make a claim, we\u2019ll give you a refund of any monies\nreceived since that date. We may also deduct any taxes or\nduties that we\u2019re unable to refund.\nIf you\u2019ve made a claim during the cooling off period and\nwish to cancel your policy, then any refund will be in\naccordance with provisions set out in the \u201cCancellation by\nyou\u201d section.\nAfter the cooling off period ends, you\u2019ll still be able to cancel\nyour policy and you have rights upon cancellation in certain\ncircumstances under the policy. See the \u201cCancellation by\nyou\u201d section for more information.\n38\nYour privacy\nRenewals of Petinsurance.com.au policies first issued before\n7 November 2023\nHollard, PIPL and PetSure (each a \u2018Recipient\u2019 and referred\nto as \u2018we\u2019, \u2018us\u2019 or \u2018our\u2019 in this Privacy section) are subject to\nthe Australian Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act 1988\n(Cth).\nAll other Petinsurance.com.au policies\nPIPL and PetSure (each a \u2018Recipient\u2019 and referred to as\n\u2018we\u2019, \u2018us\u2019 or \u2018our\u2019 in this Privacy section) are subject to the\nAustralian Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act 1988\n(Cth).\nIn connection with each Recipient:\n\u2022 personal information is collected in various ways,\nincluding via telephone, our website, hard copy forms\nor email.

We\u2019ll contact you or your\nvet if required;\n\u2022 there may be situations where we request additional\nveterinary history from current or previous vets, e.g. if\nthere\u2019s a large history gap, to ensure we have all relevant\nclinical information for your pet;\n\u2022 for adopted pets, veterinary history is only required from\nwhen you took ownership. You\u2019ll need to provide us with\nproof of adoption or transfer of ownership papers;\n\u2022 if you\u2019re making an emergency boarding claim, we may\nrequire supporting documentation;\n\u2022 unless we agree otherwise, all of your claims must\ninclude itemised tax invoice(s), payment receipt(s) and\nvet consultation notes if applicable;\n\u2022 incomplete claim forms may result in a processing\ndelay.

This advice provides\ndetails of your claim outcome and how your claim has been\nprocessed. For Hollard issued policies, all approved benefits\nwill be paid into your nominated bank account or by cheque.\nFor PetSure issued policies, we\u2019ll pay all approved benefits\ninto your nominated bank account.\nWe reserve the right to deduct from the benefit amount any\namount due to us, for example for any overdue premium\npayments.\nNote: In the event that we pay a benefit contrary to the\npolicy terms and conditions for whatever reason, this won\u2019t\nconstitute a waiver of our rights to apply the policy terms\nand conditions retrospectively to any paid claims or to any\nfuture claims for that or any related condition.\nWe also reserve our right to recover from you any benefit\namount received by you as a result of such error.\nDeclining to process your claim\nIf you or your vet refuse to or are unable to provide\ninformation reasonably requested by us to process your\nclaim, we may decline or reduce the amount payable for\nyour claim, in accordance with relevant law.\nFraudulent claims\nIf you submit a fraudulent claim or entice your vet to behave\nin a fraudulent manner regarding a claim, then the claim may\nbe denied or reduced in accordance with relevant law, and\nwe may cancel your policy altogether in the event you make\na fraudulent claim.

Total\nbenefits paid to you across all insurance cannot exceed your\nactual expenses.\nHow we prevent or handle fraud\nUnfortunately, fraud and attempted fraud can occur. We\nemploy sophisticated fraud detection and prevention\ntechniques to ensure we only pay genuine claims. By doing\nthis we\u2019re protecting you and all our policyholders.\nYou must not act in a fraudulent manner. If you or anyone\nacting for you:\n\u2022 makes a claim, submits a document, or makes a\nstatement in support of a claim under the policy\nknowing the claim, document or statement to be false or\nfraudulently exaggerated in any respect;\n\u2022 works with your vet to behave in a fraudulent manner\nregarding a claim, e.g. pressuring your vet to note\nincorrect information; or\n\u2022 makes a claim in respect of any loss or damage caused\nby your willful act or by colluding with another person;\nThen:\n\u2022 we may be entitled to refuse to pay all or part of the\nclaim, to the extent permitted by law;\n\u2022 we may cancel your policy and any other insurance\npolicies you hold with us;\n\u2022 we may be entitled to reclaim any payments already\nmade to you in respect of such claims;\n\u2022 we may not refund a premium already paid; or\n\u2022 we may inform the police of the circumstances and we\nmay take legal action.\n30\n6\nPAYING YOUR\nPREMIUM\nYour insurance policy cover is provided on the basis that\nyou\u2019ve paid or agreed to pay us the premium for that\ncover. The amount you pay is shown on your certificate of\ninsurance. It includes all premium, administration fees and\nany applicable discounts, government taxes, fees and/or\ncharges.\nWe like to think we don\u2019t miss a thing, but if you have a\nquestion about anything on your certificate of insurance,\nplease contact us.\nHow to pay\nYour pet insurance premium is payable when you take out a\nnew policy and subsequently when your policy is renewed.\nPremiums can be paid via direct debit through a credit card\nor bank account:\n\u2022 annually;\nOR\n\u2022 in monthly or fortnightly instalments.\nWhen premiums are paid in monthly or fortnightly\ninstalments, you\u2019ll be charged a collection fee per instalment,\nthe amount of which will be displayed on your certificate of\ninsurance.\nIf we accept and pay a claim under your policy, we may\ndeduct the balance of any outstanding premium from the\nclaim payment.\nPaying on time\nYou need to make sure your premium payment(s) are up to\ndate. If you have a policy that you\u2019re paying by instalments\nand we haven\u2019t received an instalment payment by its due\ndate, we\u2019ll send you a notice in writing by mail, email or text\nmessage about your non-payment.\nThis will be at least 14 calendar days before any cancellation\nof your policy for non-payment.\n31\nIf we don\u2019t receive the instalment payment after sending this\nnotice, we\u2019ll send you a second notice in writing, again by\nmail, email or text message.\nThis will happen either:\n\u2022 prior to cancellation of your policy, informing you\nthat your instalment policy is being cancelled for non-\npayment if the unpaid premium remains in arrears for\nmore than one month;\nOR\n\u2022 within 14 calendar days after cancellation by us,\nconfirming our cancellation of your instalment policy\nafter the unpaid premium was in arrears for at least one\nmonth.\nIf one or more instalments has remained unpaid for a period\nof at least 14 calendar days, then we reserve the right to\nreduce any claim made on the policy by the amount of any\noutstanding premium.\nCancellation consequences\nIf we cancel your policy due to non-payment of an\ninstalment premium, please be aware that:\n\u2022 no benefits or entitlements can be paid under the policy\nfor vet expenses or other claims expenses incurred after\nthe cancellation date;\n\u2022 you may be refused cover in the future under any policy\nadministered by PetSure; and\n\u2022 any application for general insurance products (with any\nprovider) in the future may be affected because you had\na policy cancelled because of unpaid premiums.\n32\nYour payment account\nWhen you provide us with your nominated credit card or\nbank account details, we use these to directly debit the\npremium calculated by us from that card or account.\nUnless you opt out of automatic renewals or tell us that you\ndon\u2019t want to renew your policy, we\u2019ll deduct/charge the\nrenewal premium from your nominated credit card or bank\naccount.\nIf your premium can\u2019t be paid, e.g. there isn\u2019t enough money\nin your nominated account, you may be charged a fee by\nyour bank. It\u2019s important that you know that neither Hollard\nnor PetSure will be responsible for fees charged by your\nbank or financial institution.\nIf your direct debit fails, we\u2019ll notify you of this and\nautomatically retry for the outstanding amount within\n14 calendar days. Should this second attempt fail, we\u2019ll\ntry again after 14 calendar days and, depending on your\npayment frequency, we\u2019ll deduct either the outstanding\namount, or the outstanding amount together with your\nregular instalment.\nIf you\u2019d like to make a real-time payment of your\noutstanding balance before we reattempt a direct debit, just\ncall us to do this.\nFor payments by direct debit\nFor Hollard issued policies, if the direct debit bank account is\nnot yours, you confirm you have the authority of the account\nholder to use it and that they\u2019ve agreed to these terms.\nFor PetSure issued policies, you must have the sole authority\nas the account holder of the direct debit bank account and\nagree to the Direct Debit Request Service Agreement.\nFor payments by credit card\nIf the credit card is not yours, you confirm you have the\nauthority of the credit card account holder to use it and that\nthey\u2019ve agreed to these terms.\nShould you have questions about the operation of the direct\ndebit authority or you need to change any aspects of the\nauthority, please contact us.\n33\n7\nRENEWALS,\nCANCELLATIONS\n& CHANGES\nThis part of the booklet explains your options for renewing,\ncancelling or changing the cover for your pet insurance\npolicy.\nAnnual renewal of your insurance policy\nAs long as we continue to provide the product, we\u2019ll offer\nrenewal of your policy every year. This will be subject to the\napplicable terms and conditions of the policy for each policy\nperiod. We\u2019ll change the premium and may change the terms\nand conditions of the policy at the time of renewal, based on\na combination of factors, including the risk associated with\ninsuring pets like yours.\nRenewal procedure\nWhere we offer renewal of your policy, at least 14 days\nbefore your current policy expires, we\u2019ll send you an offer\nof renewal confirming the expiry date of your policy, and\nthe premium and terms on which we\u2019ll offer to renew your\ninsurance for the next policy period.\nUnless you\u2019ve chosen not to automatically renew your policy,\nyour policy will automatically renew on those terms. Where\nyou have opted-out of automatic renewal, you\u2019ll need to\ncontact us after you\u2019ve received your offer of renewal if\nyou\u2019d like to renew your policy.\nThe notice will also remind you:\n\u2022 that you can opt out of the automatic renewal process at\nany time in the future;\n\u2022 to check the information we have on your certificate of\ninsurance is correct; and\n\u2022 to review your insurance cover to consider if the policy\nlimits and level of cover are still right for you.\n34\nUnless you opt out of automatic renewals or tell us that you\ndon\u2019t want to renew your policy, we\u2019ll deduct/charge the\nrenewal premium from your nominated account or credit\ncard. See the \u201cYour payment account\u201d section for more\ninformation.\nYour premium\nEvery year, we\u2019ll notify you of the changes to your annual\npremium. We review the cost of everyone\u2019s insurance, taking\naccount of a range of factors. These are set out under the\n\u201cHow we calculate your premium\u201d section.\nCancellation by you\nYou can cancel your policy with us at any time by contacting\nour customer service team. Our \u201dContact details\u201d are on the\nlast page of this booklet.\nThe cancellation will be effective once we provide you with\na written confirmation of your request, either by email or\nletter.\nPaying annually?\nIf you\u2019ve been paying your premiums annually, we\u2019ll retain a\nportion of the premium that relates to the period that you\u2019ve\nbeen insured. We\u2019ll refund you the residual premium for the\nunexpired period (less any government or statutory charges\nthat apply). We call this providing you a pro-rata refund,\nbased on the number of days we insured you.\nPaying by instalment?\nIf you\u2019ve been paying your premiums by instalment, there\u2019s\nno premium refund for any remaining days of a current\ninstalment period. No further premium instalments will be\ndeducted.\nIf your pet passes away\nWe know there is a lot going on when your pet passes away,\nbut we\u2019re here to help. Please contact us as soon as possible\nand we\u2019ll cancel your policy from the date of your pet\npassing. We\u2019ll adjust the premium, as outlined above.\nYour cancellation rights during the cooling off period\nYour cooling off cancellation rights apply when you buy\nyour policy and also exist when your policy renews or is\nreissued following a change in your cover. You can find more\ninformation in the \u201cCooling off period\u201d section.\n35\nCancellation by us\nWe may cancel your policy where permitted by and in\naccordance with the law. We\u2019ll give you notice in writing\nbefore exercising any right to cancel your policy. For\nexample, if you:\n\u2022 do not comply with the policy terms and conditions;\n\u2022 do not pay your premium as agreed;\n\u2022 make a fraudulent claim; or\n\u2022 did not comply with your duty to take reasonable care\nnot to make a misrepresentation.\nIf we cancel your policy, we\u2019ll retain and/or refund any\npremium as the law allows us to do so.\nChanging your cover\nYou can change the cover for your pet by choosing cover\nwith different or additional benefits, where eligible and\navailable to you. You may, for example, want a different\nbenefit percentage or benefit limit, or to upgrade your\ncoverage.\nIf you haven\u2019t had a claim paid and want to change your\ncover, just contact us and we\u2019ll issue you a new policy\nnumber and certificate of insurance outlining your new\npremium and your previous policy number will be cancelled.\nHowever, you can\u2019t change your cover if a claim has been\npaid during your current policy period. You\u2019ll need to wait\nuntil your next policy renewal.\nWaiting periods already completed won\u2019t be reapplied\nunless there has been a break or lapse in your cover. If you\nchange the Petinsurance.com.au product you have for your\npet, with a different level of cover, waiting periods will only\napply to any conditions covered by the new product that\nweren\u2019t covered under your previous product.\n36\n8\nOTHER\nIMPORTANT\nINFORMATION\nThis section includes other important information on how\nwe communicate with you, your duty to take reasonable\ncare not to make a misrepresentation, how we calculate your\npremium and more.\nDelivery of your policy documents\nUnless you instruct us otherwise, we prefer to send your\npolicy documents and communicate with you electronically.\nWhere you\u2019ve agreed to receive electronic communications,\nyou\u2019ll need to provide us with your email address and mobile\nnumber.\nWhen we send your policy documents by email, we\u2019ll\nconsider that you have received them on the date recorded\non our information system.\nYou can instruct us to provide these documents by post, to a\nmailing address you provide, either when you purchase your\npolicy or at any time by contacting us.\nYou\u2019re responsible for making sure the email and postal\naddresses you\u2019ve given us are correct and up-to-date at all\ntimes.\nYour duty to take reasonable care not to make a\nmisrepresentation\nBefore you enter into this contract of insurance with us,\nyou have a duty to take reasonable care not to make a\nmisrepresentation under the Insurance Contracts Act 1984\n(Cth).\nThis means you need to take reasonable care to provide\nhonest, accurate and complete answers to any questions\nthat we ask. It is very important that you do so, as we base\nour decision whether to provide cover and the terms on\nwhich we do so on your answers.\n37\nIf you\u2019re not sure of the answers to any of our questions,\nyou should take the time to find them. It\u2019s also important\nto understand that, in answering the questions, you\u2019re\nanswering for yourself and anyone else to whom the\nquestions apply.\nIf any of our questions aren\u2019t clear and you need help, please\ncontact us.\nWhen this duty applies\nThe duty to take reasonable care not to make a\nmisrepresentation also applies before you renew, vary,\nextend or reinstate an existing contract of insurance. This\nmeans that you must inform us of any changes to the\ninformation set out in your certificate of insurance, where the\ninformation is no longer honest, accurate and complete. If\nyou don\u2019t contact us to update this information, we\u2019ll take it\nthat you agree that the information remains honest, accurate\nand complete. Please contact us if you have any doubts.\nIf you don\u2019t comply with your duty\nIf you don\u2019t take reasonable care in answering our questions\nor inform us of changes to the information set out in\nyour policy documents, you may breach your duty. If that\nhappens, your policy may be cancelled, or treated as if it\nnever existed, and any claim may be denied or not paid in\nfull.\nUpdates to the PDS\nWe may need to update this PDS from time to time when\ncertain changes occur and where we\u2019re required and\npermitted by law to do so. If that happens, we\u2019ll issue you\nwith a new PDS or a Supplementary PDS or other compliant\ndocument to update the relevant information.\nWhere the information isn\u2019t materially adverse from the\npoint of view of a reasonable person considering whether\nto buy or continue to hold this insurance, we may issue you\nwith notice in a different form, including but not limited to\ndisclosure updates on the PetSure and/or\nPetinsurance.com.au website(s).\nYou can contact us to get a free paper copy or download an\nelectronic copy that summarises these changes.\nHow we calculate your premium\nYour premium is calculated when your Petinsurance.com.au\npolicy begins, at each policy anniversary, and also if you vary\nyour cover. The premium for each policy period is printed on\nyour certificate of insurance.\n38\nThe amount you pay also includes allowances for\ngovernment fees, taxes and charges, including stamp duty\nand GST.\nFor new policies\nWe calculate your premium based on several factors. Some\nare pre-set and don\u2019t vary, e.g. amounts we consider for\nsome internal expenses. Others can affect the premium\namount depending on whether we believe it increases or\ndecreases the risk to us. For example, the type of cover and\noptions you have selected.\nWe\u2019ll also take into account risk factors associated with\nyou and your pet such as your pet\u2019s breed and age. For\ninstance, as your pet gets older the risk of your pet requiring\ntreatment will increase and so the premium increases.\nThere are also commercial factors that affect your premium,\nincluding costs associated with operating our business and\nour commercial arrangements.\nYour premium calculation may also include discounts or\npromotional offers that we provide. If you qualify for two or\nmore discounts, we apply a specific order to our calculation\nof your final premium.\nAlso, any discounts and/or your premium may be rounded\nup or down and some may only apply in the first year of\ncoverage.\nFor renewals and changes to your policy\nFor renewals, we also factor in the claim history for your pet\nand the average cost of care for pets like yours, as well as\nthe claims experience across all our insured pets. Because of\nall of these factors and the changes to your pet\u2019s risk profile,\nyour premium will increase from year to year.\nWhen calculating your premium on renewal, we also\nconsider how much your premium was previously, including\nany discounts that may have been applied. This means that\nwe may limit movements up or down.\nThese same factors and others are also used to calculate\nyour premium if you amend your coverage.\nFor information about how and when to pay your premium,\nplease read the \u201cPaying your premium\u201d section.\n39\nCooling off period\nYou have a 30 day period to ensure you\u2019re happy with every\naspect of your policy.\nDuring this time, you can contact us and cancel your policy.\nIf we receive your request to cancel your policy within the\n30 day period after the policy commencement date or\nrenewal date and as long as you\u2019ve not made a claim or\nintend to make a claim, we\u2019ll give you a refund of any monies\nreceived since that date. We may also deduct any taxes or\nduties that we\u2019re unable to refund.\nIf you\u2019ve made a claim during the cooling off period and\nwish to cancel your policy, then any refund will be in\naccordance with provisions set out in the \u201cCancellation by\nyou\u201d section.\nAfter the cooling off period ends, you\u2019ll still be able to cancel\nyour policy and you have rights upon cancellation in certain\ncircumstances under the policy. See the \u201cCancellation by\nyou\u201d section for more information.\n40\nYour privacy\nRenewals of Petinsurance.com.au policies first issued before\n7 November 2023\nHollard, PIPL and PetSure (each a \u2018Recipient\u2019 and referred\nto as \u2018we\u2019, \u2018us\u2019 or \u2018our\u2019 in this Privacy section) are subject to\nthe Australian Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act 1988\n(Cth).\nAll other Petinsurance.com.au policies\nPIPL and PetSure (each a \u2018Recipient\u2019 and referred to as\n\u2018we\u2019, \u2018us\u2019 or \u2018our\u2019 in this Privacy section) are subject to the\nAustralian Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act 1988\n(Cth).\nIn connection with each Recipient:\n\u2022 personal information is collected in various ways,\nincluding via telephone, our website, hard copy forms\nor email.

Words that are italicised\nin this booklet have the special meaning explained in this\nsection.\nBenefit limit and Sub-limit(s) means as follows:\nBenefit limit means the applicable maximum amount\npayable by us in any one policy period, for your cover.\nSub-limit(s) means the applicable maximum amount(s)\npayable by us in any one policy period, for particular items,\ntreatments or conditions that you have cover for.\nThe amounts of your benefit limit and sub-limit(s), together\nwith particular items subject to sub-limit(s) are specified on\nyour certificate of insurance.\nAlso note:\n\u2022 we\u2019ll never pay more than the overall annual benefit limit\nor sub-limit specified on your certificate of insurance.\nThis means that if a sub-limit applies for a particular item\nof cover, condition or treatment, we won\u2019t pay more than\nthat amount, either on an individual or per claim basis for\nthat item. This is also subject to the overall benefit limit\nor other relevant sub-limit not having been exceeded.\n\u2022 the benefit limit and sub-limits are reset when you\nrenew your policy. This means that policy benefits don\u2019t\naccumulate across policy periods. They expire at the end\nof each policy period.\n\u2022 the benefit limit and sub-limits are also subject to the\nexcess (if any) applicable to your cover.\n51\nBenefit percentage means the stated percentage of each\nclaim for eligible vet expenses and eligible costs for covered\nitems which we reimburse, subject to the applicable benefit\nlimit or sub-limit and excesses. The applicable benefit\npercentage will be shown on your certificate of insurance.\nNote: The benefit percentage does not apply to routine care\nitems.\nBilateral condition means any condition affecting body parts\non each side of your pet\u2019s body, e.g. ears, eyes, knees or\nelbows.\nA bilateral condition is considered a single condition\nwhen applying a benefit limit, sub-limit, excess (if any) or\nexclusion.\nExample 1: if your pet displays signs or symptoms of a\ncruciate ligament condition in the left knee prior to the\ncommencement date of the first policy period or during the\napplicable waiting period, and this falls within the definition\nof a pre-existing condition, a subsequent cruciate ligament\ncondition in the right knee will still be considered a pre-\nexisting condition.\nExample 2: if your pet suffers from a cruciate ligament\ncondition in its left hind leg and patella luxation in its right\nhind leg, this is not a bilateral condition. Cruciate ligament\nconditions and patella luxation aren\u2019t the same condition.\nCertificate of insurance is the certificate we provide you that\noutlines the key details of the contract of insurance between\nyou and us. It includes the policy number, cover, excess (if\nany), commencement date, end date, insured pet details, and\nthe schedule of benefits, including benefit limits, sub-limits\nand dental illness limit (if applicable).\nNote: A certificate of insurance is issued to you when we\naccept your application for cover, on each renewal, and\nwhenever your policy is amended.\nChronic condition means a long-lasting condition which\nis recurring or present in your pet over a period greater\nthan three months in total, however the three-month\nperiod need not be consecutive. Chronic conditions may\nalso be intermittent or managed with medication and/or\nprescription diets with intervals of remission.\n52\nExamples include (but aren\u2019t limited to): chronic or\nseasonal allergies, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes,\nosteoarthritis, cancer and some autoimmune diseases.\nIf a chronic condition is a pre-existing condition, it will\nalways be excluded from cover. That means, it will never be\nconsidered a temporary condition.\nCommencement date unless otherwise specified, is the date\nwhen cover for your pet started in the current policy period\nas shown on your certificate of insurance. The start time is\n11:59PM on that date.\nNote: Also see the first policy period definition for\ncommencement date of first policy period.\nCondition means a condition resulting from an accidental\ninjury or manifestation of an illness.\nNote: Only conditions that are specified accidental injuries,\nspecified illnesses and/or specified dental conditions (where\ncovered under the dental illness benefit) are eligible for\ncover under your policy.\nConsultation and other derivations means an examination\nperformed by or under the supervision of a vet, including\na physical consultation, inpatient examination, in-hospital\nexamination, health certificate, consultation or recheck\nconsultation/visit, referral/specialist consultation/visits,\nphone consultation, web consultation and emergency and\nafter-hours consultations/visits.\nNote: Any applicable sub-limit will be shown on your\ncertificate of insurance.\nCover means:\n\u2022 the benefit limit, sub-limits, excess (if any), benefit\npercentage and any other optional or additional benefits\n(including their limits) applicable to your selected policy;\nand\n\u2022 the cover applicable under your policy for your selected\nplan and any previous policies you\u2019ve held with us where\nthe same or a substantially similar or a higher level of\ncover was provided in the current policy period, without\nany break or time without holding the cover.\nNote: Your certificate of insurance tells you which plan\nyou have. The cover for your plan comprises of specified\naccidental injury cover, specified illness cover, additional\nbenefits and any selected optional benefits.\n53\nCruciate ligament condition means partial or complete\nrupture of the cruciate ligament(s). This includes meniscal\ntears, any looseness of the cruciate ligaments, along with\nany complications following treatment for this condition.\nDental illness benefit means the dental illness benefit\ndescribed in the \u201cAdditional and optional benefits\u201d section\nwhich provides benefits, up to the dental illness limit, for\neligible vet expenses incurred in relation to specified dental\nconditions.\nDental illness limit means the dental illness limit amount\nspecified on your certificate of insurance which is additional\nto your policy\u2019s benefit limit.\nIf you have the dental illness benefit, also note:\n\u2022 we\u2019ll never pay more than the dental illness limit\nspecified on your certificate of insurance.\n\u2022 the dental illness limit resets if you renew your policy.\nThis means that policy benefits for the dental illness\nbenefit don\u2019t accumulate across policy periods. They\nexpire at the end of each policy period.\n\u2022 the dental illness limit is also subject to the excess (if\nany) applicable to your cover.\nElective treatment means a treatment or surgery that is\nbeneficial to your pet but is not essential for your pet\u2019s\nsurvival and doesn\u2019t form part of the treatment for a covered\ncondition.\nEnd date is the date when your policy terminates. No further\nbenefits or entitlements can be paid under the policy for vet\nexpenses or other claims expenses incurred after the end\ndate. The end time is 11:59PM on that date.\nUnless otherwise specified, this relates to the end date of\nyour current policy period.\nThe end date is shown on your certificate of insurance. If\nthe policy is cancelled, then the date of cancellation will be\ndeemed to be the end date.\n54\nExcess means an amount you contribute towards the cost of\nyour claim(s), as shown on your certificate of insurance. The\nexcess is calculated on a \u2018per condition, per policy period\u2019\nbasis. We do this for each condition treated that is unrelated\nto any other condition during the same policy period. Your\nexcess also applies to each emergency boarding claim event.\nThe excess will be deducted from your calculated claim\nbenefits after we apply any benefit limit, sub-limit and the\nbenefit percentage to your claimed amount.\nPet means the dog or cat covered under the policy and\nnamed on your certificate of insurance.\nPolicy period means the time during which we provide cover\nas specified on your certificate of insurance.\nNote: Unless otherwise specified, this relates to your current\npolicy period.\n55\nPre-existing condition means a condition that first existed or\noccurred:\n\u2022 prior to the commencement date of the first policy\nperiod; or\n\u2022 within any applicable waiting period; AND\n\u2022 of which you were aware of, or a reasonable person in\nyour circumstances would have been aware, irrespective\nof whether the underlying or causative condition has\nbeen diagnosed.\nA pre-existing condition also includes a related condition or\nbilateral condition of a pre-existing condition.\nRelated condition means a condition that results from the\nsame disease process, arises as a consequence of or has\nthe same diagnostic classification as another condition,\nregardless of the number of areas of your pet\u2019s body that\nare affected.\nExamples\n\u2022 if your pet suffers from IVDD on its thoracic region, all\nfuture occurrences of IVDD, e.g. in the lumbar region, will\nbe related conditions.\n\u2022 if your pet suffers from anaphylaxis from a bee sting, all\nfuture occurrences of anaphylaxis from bee stings will\nthen be related conditions.\n\u2022 if your pet suffers from a heatstroke, then later suffers\nfrom thermal burns from a hot water spill, these aren\u2019t\nrelated conditions, as the thermal burns are not as a\nconsequence of the heatstroke, nor do they follow the\nsame disease process or diagnostic classification.\nRoutine care means certain pet care items for your pet listed\non your certificate of insurance which are non-insurance\nbenefits. If you have these benefits, the list of allowable\nitems and the maximum amount payable during the policy\nperiod, are shown on your certificate of insurance.\n56\nSpecified accidental injury means physical harm or injury\narising from at least one of the following:\n\u2022 a motor vehicle incident;\n\u2022 a burn or electrocution;\n\u2022 a reaction to a bite from an insect, spider or scorpion\n(excluding fleas);\n\u2022 a near drowning incident;\nOR\nthe specified accidental injury must be one of the following:\n\u2022 a bone fracture;\n\u2022 a traumatic tooth fracture;\n\u2022 snake bite toxicity;\n\u2022 poisoning;\n\u2022 ingestion of a foreign object;\n\u2022 a traumatic ligament or tendon injury;\n\u2022 a bite wound or fight wound abscesses;\n\u2022 lacerations or abrasion of tissue, skin or mucous\nmembrane due to external trauma; or\n\u2022 a cruciate ligament condition.\nNote: We define an accident as a single unexpected event\nthat is unintended by you and is independent of any illness\nor specified dental condition.

These are\nexamples only and include GST.\nExample 1\nThis is a simple case showing how the policy benefit percentage\nand excess is applied.\n80% benefit percentage and $100 excess option selected\nThe eligible invoice amount from your vet for $2,000\ntreatment\nThe amount you can claim after applying your $1,600\nbenefit percentage\nLess $100 excess ($100)\nHow much we pay $1,500\nYour out-of-pocket expense including your $500\nexcess\nExample 2\nThis one shows how a claim is paid for a policy item where a\nsub-limit and excess applies.\nClaim for hip joint surgery to the left hip.\n70% benefit percentage with a $4,000 hip joint surgery sub-\nlimit per hip per policy period and $250 excess option selected.\nThe eligible invoice amount from your vet for $5,000\ntreatment to the left hip\nThe amount you can claim after applying your $3,500\nbenefit percentage and hip joint surgery sub-\nlimit for the left hip\nLess $250 excess ($250)\nHow much we pay $3,250\nYour out-of-pocket expense including your $1,750\nexcess\n28\nOur right to recover other amounts payable\nIf we have the right to recover any amount payable under your\npolicy in relation to a claim from any other person, you must\nprovide reasonable cooperation with us in any action we may\ntake.\nTelling us about other insurance you have\nIf you hold other insurance under which you may be entitled\nto make a claim in relation to eligible vet expenses, you must\nadvise us of this at the time you submit your claim. Total benefits\npaid to you across all insurance cannot exceed your actual\nexpenses.\nHow we prevent or handle fraud\nUnfortunately, fraud and attempted fraud can occur. We\nemploy sophisticated fraud detection and prevention\ntechniques to ensure we only pay genuine claims. By doing this\nwe\u2019re protecting you and all our policyholders.\nYou must not act in a fraudulent manner. If you or anyone acting\nfor you:\n\u2022 makes a claim, submits a document, or makes a statement\nin support of a claim under the policy knowing the\nclaim, document or statement to be false or fraudulently\nexaggerated in any respect;\n\u2022 works with your vet to behave in a fraudulent manner\nregarding a claim, e.g. pressuring your vet to note incorrect\ninformation; or\n\u2022 makes a claim in respect of any loss or damage caused by\nyour wilful act or by colluding with another person;\nThen:\n\u2022 we may be entitled to refuse to pay all or part of the claim,\nto the extent permitted by law;\n\u2022 we may cancel your policy and any other insurance policies\nyou hold with us;\n\u2022 we may be entitled to reclaim any payments already made\nto you in respect of such claims;\n\u2022 we may not refund a premium already paid; or\n\u2022 we may inform the police of the circumstances and we may\ntake legal action.\n29\n6 Paying your\npremium\nYour insurance policy cover is provided on the basis that\nyou\u2019ve paid or agreed to pay us the premium for that cover.\nThe amount you pay is shown on your certificate of insurance.\nIt includes all premium, administration fees and any applicable\ndiscounts, government taxes, fees and/or charges.\nWe like to think we don\u2019t miss a thing, but if you have a question\nabout anything on your certificate of insurance, please contact\nus.\nHow to pay\nYour pet insurance premium is payable when you take out a new\npolicy and subsequently when your policy is renewed.\nPremiums can be paid via direct debit through a credit card or\nbank account:\n\u2022 annually;\nOR\n\u2022 in monthly or fortnightly instalments.\nWhen premiums are paid in monthly or fortnightly instalments,\nyou\u2019ll be charged a collection fee per instalment, the amount of\nwhich will be displayed on your certificate of insurance.\nIf we accept and pay a claim under your policy, we may deduct\nthe balance of any outstanding premium from the claim\npayment.\nPaying on time\nYou need to make sure your premium payment(s) are up to date.\nIf you have a policy that you\u2019re paying by instalments and we\nhaven\u2019t received an instalment payment by its due date, we\u2019ll\nsend you a notice in writing by mail, email or text message\nabout your non-payment.\nThis will be at least 14 calendar days before any cancellation of\nyour policy for non-payment.\nIf we don\u2019t receive the instalment payment after sending this\nnotice, we\u2019ll send you a second notice in writing, again by mail,\nemail or text message.\n30\nThis will happen either:\n\u2022 prior to cancellation of your policy, informing you that your\ninstalment policy is being cancelled for non-payment if\nthe unpaid premium remains in arrears for more than one\nmonth;\nOR\n\u2022 within 14 calendar days after cancellation by us, confirming\nour cancellation of your instalment policy after the unpaid\npremium was in arrears for at least one month.\nIf one or more instalments has remained unpaid for a period of\nat least 14 calendar days, then we reserve the right to reduce\nany claim made on the policy by the amount of any outstanding\npremium.\nCancellation consequences\nIf we cancel your policy due to non-payment of an instalment\npremium, please be aware that:\n\u2022 no benefits or entitlements will be payable under the policy\nfor vet expenses or other claims expenses incurred after the\ncancellation date;\n\u2022 applications for other general insurance products\nadministered by PetSure may be refused; and\n\u2022 any application for general insurance products (with any\nprovider) in the future may be affected because you had a\npolicy cancelled because of unpaid premiums.\nYour payment account\nWhen you provide us with your nominated credit card or bank\naccount details, we use these to directly debit the premium\ncalculated by us from that card or account.\nUnless you opt out of automatic renewals or tell us that you\ndon\u2019t want to renew your policy, we\u2019ll deduct/charge the\nrenewal premium from your nominated credit card or bank\naccount.\nIf your premium can\u2019t be paid, e.g. there isn\u2019t enough money in\nyour nominated account, you may be charged a fee by your\nbank. It\u2019s important that you know that neither Hollard nor\nPetSure will be responsible for fees charged by your bank or\nfinancial institution.\nIf your direct debit fails, we\u2019ll notify you of this and automatically\nretry for the outstanding amount within 14 calendar days. Should\nthis second attempt fail, we\u2019ll try again after 14 calendar days\nand, depending on your payment frequency, we\u2019ll deduct either\nthe outstanding amount, or the outstanding amount together\nwith your regular instalment.\n31\nIf you\u2019d like to make a real-time payment of your outstanding\nbalance before we reattempt a direct debit, just call us to do\nthis.\nFor payments by direct debit\nFor Hollard issued policies, if the direct debit bank account is\nnot yours, you confirm you have the authority of the account\nholder to use it and that they\u2019ve agreed to these terms.\nFor PetSure issued policies, you must have the sole authority as\nthe account holder of the direct debit bank account and agree\nto the Direct Debit Request Service Agreement.\nFor payments by credit card\nIf the credit card is not yours, you confirm you have the\nauthority of the credit card account holder to use it and that\nthey\u2019ve agreed to these terms.\nShould you have questions about the operation of the direct\ndebit authority or you need to change any aspects of the\nauthority, please contact us.\n32\n7 Renewals,\ncancellations\n& changes\nThis part of the booklet explains your options for renewing,\ncancelling or changing the cover for your pet insurance policy.\nAnnual renewal of your insurance policy\nAs long as we continue to provide the product, we\u2019ll offer\nrenewal of your policy every year. This will be subject to the\napplicable terms and conditions of the policy for each policy\nperiod. We\u2019ll change the premium and may change the terms\nand conditions of the policy at the time of renewal, based on\na combination of factors, including the risk associated with\ninsuring pets like yours.\nRenewal procedure\nWhere we offer renewal of your policy, at least 14 days before\nyour current policy expires, we\u2019ll send you an offer of renewal\nconfirming the expiry date of your policy, and the premium and\nterms on which we\u2019ll offer to renew your insurance for the next\npolicy period.\nUnless you\u2019ve chosen not to automatically renew your policy,\nyour policy will automatically renew on those terms. Where you\nhave opted-out of automatic renewal, you\u2019ll need to contact us\nafter you\u2019ve received your offer of renewal if you\u2019d like to renew\nyour policy.\nThe notice will also remind you:\n\u2022 that you can opt out of the automatic renewal process at\nany time in the future;\n\u2022 to check the information we have on your certificate of\ninsurance is correct; and\n\u2022 to review your insurance cover to consider if the policy limits\nand level of cover are still right for you.\nUnless you opt out of automatic renewals or tell us that you\ndon\u2019t want to renew your policy, we\u2019ll deduct/charge the\nrenewal premium from your nominated account or credit card.\nSee the \u201cYour payment account\u201d section for more information.\n33\nYour premium\nEvery year, we\u2019ll notify you of the changes to your annual\npremium. We review the cost of everyone\u2019s insurance, taking\naccount of a range of factors. These are set out under the \u201cHow\nwe calculate your premium\u201d section.\nCancellation by you\nYou can cancel your policy with us at any time by contacting\nour customer service team. Our \u201cContact details\u201d are on the last\npage of this booklet.\nThe cancellation will be effective once we provide you with a\nwritten confirmation of your request, either by email or letter.\nWe\u2019ll retain the portion of the premium that relates to the period\nthat you\u2019ve been insured up to your cancellation date. Where\nyou have paid for a period in advance (e.g. for the fortnight,\nmonth, or year), we\u2019ll refund that proportion of premium for\nthe time remaining on the policy (less any non-refundable\ngovernment or statutory charges and less any collection fee\ncharges).\nIf your pet passes away\nWe know there is a lot going on when your pet passes away, but\nwe\u2019re here to help. Please contact us as soon as possible and\nwe\u2019ll cancel your policy from the date of your pet\u2019s passing. We\u2019ll\nadjust the premium, as outlined above.\nYour cancellation rights during the cooling off period\nYour cooling off cancellation rights apply when you buy your\npolicy and also exist when your policy renews or is reissued\nfollowing a change in your cover. You can find more information\nin the \u201cCooling off period\u201d section.\nCancellation by us\nWe may cancel your policy where permitted by and in\naccordance with the law. We\u2019ll give you notice in writing before\nexercising any right to cancel your policy. For example, if you:\n\u2022 do not comply with the policy terms and conditions;\n\u2022 do not pay your premium as agreed;\n\u2022 make a fraudulent claim; or\n\u2022 did not comply with your duty to take reasonable care not to\nmake a misrepresentation.\nIf we cancel your policy, we\u2019ll retain and/or refund any premium\nas the law allows us to do so.\n34\nChanging your cover\nYou can change the cover for your pet by choosing cover with\ndifferent or additional benefits, where eligible and available to\nyou. You may, for example, want a different benefit percentage\nor benefit limit, or to upgrade your coverage.\nIf you haven\u2019t had a claim paid and want to change your cover,\njust contact us and we\u2019ll issue you a new policy number and\ncertificate of insurance outlining your new premium and your\nprevious policy number will be cancelled.\nHowever, you can\u2019t change your cover if a claim has been paid\nduring your current policy period. You\u2019ll need to wait until your\nnext policy renewal.\nWaiting periods already completed won\u2019t be reapplied unless\nthere has been a break or lapse in your cover. If you change the\nMedibank Pet Insurance product you have for your pet, with a\ndifferent level of cover, waiting periods will only apply to any\nconditions or benefits covered by the new product that weren\u2019t\ncovered under your previous product.\n35\n8 Other\nimportant\ninformation\nThis section includes other important information on how we\ncommunicate with you, your duty to take reasonable care not to\nmake a misrepresentation, how we calculate your premium and\nmore.\nDelivery of your policy documents\nUnless you instruct us otherwise, we prefer to send your policy\ndocuments and communicate with you electronically. Where\nyou\u2019ve agreed to receive electronic communications, you\u2019ll\nneed to provide us with your email address and mobile number.\nWhen we send your policy documents by email, we\u2019ll consider\nthat you have received them on the date recorded on our\ninformation system.\nYou can instruct us to provide these documents by post, to a\nmailing address you provide, either when you purchase your\npolicy or at any time by contacting us.\nYou\u2019re responsible for making sure the email and postal\naddresses you\u2019ve given us are correct and up-to-date at all\ntimes.\nYour duty to take reasonable care not to make a\nmisrepresentation\nBefore you enter into this contract of insurance with us,\nyou have a duty to take reasonable care not to make a\nmisrepresentation under the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth).\nThis means you need to take reasonable care to provide honest,\naccurate and complete answers to any questions that we ask.\nIt is very important that you do so, as we base our decision\nwhether to provide cover and the terms on which we do so on\nyour answers.\nIf you\u2019re not sure of the answers to any of our questions,\nyou should take the time to find them. It\u2019s also important to\nunderstand that, in answering the questions, you\u2019re answering\nfor yourself and anyone else to whom the questions apply.\nIf any of our questions aren\u2019t clear and you need help, please\ncontact us.\n36\nWhen this duty applies\nThe duty to take reasonable care not to make a\nmisrepresentation also applies before you renew, vary, extend\nor reinstate an existing contract of insurance. This means that\nyou must inform us of any changes to the information set out\nin your certificate of insurance, where the information is no\nlonger honest, accurate and complete. If you don\u2019t contact us\nto update this information, we\u2019ll take it that you agree that the\ninformation remains honest, accurate and complete. Please\ncontact us if you have any doubts.\nIf you don\u2019t comply with your duty\nIf you don\u2019t take reasonable care in answering our questions or\ninform us of changes to the information set out in your policy\ndocuments, you may breach your duty. If that happens, your\npolicy may be cancelled, or treated as if it never existed, and\nany claim may be denied or not paid in full.\nUpdates to the PDS\nWe may need to update this PDS from time to time when certain\nchanges occur and where we\u2019re required and permitted by law\nto do so. If that happens, we\u2019ll issue you with a new PDS or a\nSupplementary PDS or other compliant document to update the\nrelevant information.\nWhere the information isn\u2019t materially adverse from the point\nof view of a reasonable person considering whether to buy or\ncontinue to hold this insurance, we may issue you with notice in\na different form, including but not limited to disclosure updates\non the PetSure and/or Medibank website(s).\nYou can contact us to get a free paper copy or download an\nelectronic copy that summarises these changes.\n37\nHow we calculate your premium\nYour premium is calculated when your Medibank Pet Insurance\npolicy begins, at each policy anniversary, and also if you vary\nyour cover. The premium for each policy period is printed on\nyour certificate of insurance.\nThe amount you pay also includes allowances for government\nfees, taxes and charges, including stamp duty and GST.\nFor new policies\nWe calculate your premium based on several factors. Some\nare pre-set and don\u2019t vary, e.g. amounts we consider for some\ninternal expenses. Others can affect the premium amount\ndepending on whether we believe it increases or decreases the\nrisk to us. For example, the type of cover and options you have\nselected.\nWe\u2019ll also take into account risk factors associated with you\nand your pet such as your pet\u2019s breed and age. For instance, as\nyour pet gets older the risk of your pet requiring treatment will\nincrease and so the premium increases.\nThere are also commercial factors that affect your premium,\nincluding costs associated with operating our business and our\ncommercial arrangements.\nYour premium calculation may also include discounts or\npromotional offers that we provide. If you qualify for two or more\ndiscounts, we apply a specific order to our calculation of your\nfinal premium.\nAlso, any discounts and/or your premium may be rounded up or\ndown and some may only apply in the first year of coverage.\nFor renewals and changes to your policy\nFor renewals, we also factor in the claim history for your pet and\nthe average cost of care for pets like yours, as well as the claims\nexperience across all our insured pets. Because of all of these\nfactors and the changes to your pet\u2019s risk profile, your premium\nwill increase from year to year.\nWhen calculating your premium on renewal, we also consider\nhow much your premium was previously, including any discounts\nthat may have been applied. This means that we may limit\nmovements up or down.\nThese same factors and others are also used to calculate your\npremium if you amend your coverage.\nFor information about how and when to pay your premium,\nplease read the \u201cPaying your premium\u201d section.\n38\nCooling off period\nYou have a 21 day period to ensure you\u2019re happy with every\naspect of your policy.\nDuring this time, you can contact us and cancel your policy. If\nwe receive your request to cancel your policy within the 21 day\nperiod after the policy commencement date or renewal date\nand as long as you\u2019ve not made a claim or intend to make a\nclaim, we\u2019ll give you a refund of any monies received since that\ndate. We may also deduct any taxes or duties that we\u2019re unable\nto refund.\nIf you\u2019ve made a claim during the cooling off period and wish to\ncancel your policy, then any refund will be in accordance with\nprovisions set out in the \u201cCancellation by you\u201d section.\nAfter the cooling off period ends, you\u2019ll still be able to cancel\nyour policy and you have rights upon cancellation in certain\ncircumstances under the policy. See the \u201cCancellation by you\u201d\nsection for more information.\n39\nHow to make a complaint\nWe hope you\u2019ll never have reason to complain, but if you do,\nwe\u2019ll do our best to work with you to resolve it.\nOur complaints resolution process has three steps.

Words that are italicised in\nthis booklet have the special meaning explained in this section.\nBehavioural condition means behavioural conditions\ndiagnosed by a vet including but not limited to anxiety, phobias,\ncompulsive disorders and impulse control problems.\nNote: Behavioural conditions may be eligible for cover under\n\u201cExtra care\u201d if you have this.\nBenefit limit and Sub-limit(s) means as follows:\nBenefit limit means the applicable maximum amount payable\nby us in any one policy period, for your cover (but excluding\nextra care, if you have this.

This\nmeans that if a sub-limit applies for a particular item of\ncover, condition or treatment, we won\u2019t pay more than that\namount, either on an individual or per claim basis for that\nitem. This is also subject to the overall benefit limit or other\nrelevant sub-limit not having been exceeded.\n\u2022 The benefit limit and sub-limits are reset when you\nrenew your policy. This means that policy benefits don\u2019t\naccumulate across policy periods.

This\nmeans that policy benefits for extra care don\u2019t accumulate\nacross policy periods.

We\u2019ll then respond\nto you (and your vet if submitted on your behalf) in writing\nwith the outcome. A pre-approval isn\u2019t valid unless we\u2019ve\nagreed to it in writing.\nNote: If we agree to a pre-approval but the treatment\nprovided by your vet differs from the treatment request in\nthe pre-approval, then our assessment of the amount we\ncover under your claim may vary from the notified pre-\napproval amount. A variation in the amount we cover may\nalso occur if you have reached your benefit limit, sub-limit\nor other applicable limit on the claim.\nand calculates your pet insurance claim benefits while you\u2019re\nstill at the vet. If your vet is GapOnly\u00ae enabled, you don\u2019t\nneed to pay your vet in full prior to the submission of your\nclaim. Instead, your vet submits the claim to us electronically\non your behalf and you agree to pay the \u2018gap\u2019 (the difference\nbetween the vet\u2019s invoice and the claim benefit calculated, if\nany, under your policy).\nYou must pay the gap to your treating vet at the time you\nmake a GapOnly\u00ae claim. We\u2019ll then pay the claim benefit (if\nany) directly to your vet.\nYou can find more information on GapOnly\u00ae here: www.\ngaponly.com.au.\nGapOnly\u00ae claim, we\u2019ll pay the claim benefits to you, not your\nvet.\n25\nYou agree that we\u2019re authorised to discuss with your vet, the\ndetails relating to your claim or the treatment provided to\nyour pet in relation to a claim made under your policy. You\nalso agree that your vet is authorised to view the outcome\nof your claim, including the amount of claims benefits.\nPlease note that:\n\u2022 in some instances, we may require more information to\nprocess your claim, such as previous medical history or\npathology/laboratory results. We\u2019ll contact you or your\nvet if required;\n\u2022 there may be situations where we request additional\nveterinary history from current or previous vets, e.g. if\nthere\u2019s a large history gap, to ensure we have all relevant\nclinical information for your pet;\n\u2022 for adopted pets, veterinary history is only required from\nwhen you took ownership. You\u2019ll need to provide us with\nproof of adoption or transfer of ownership papers;\n\u2022 if you\u2019re making an emergency boarding claim, we may\nrequire supporting documentation;\n\u2022 unless we agree otherwise, all of your claims must\ninclude itemised tax invoice(s), payment receipt(s) and\nvet consultation notes if applicable;\n\u2022 incomplete claim forms may result in a processing\ndelay.

This advice provides\ndetails of your claim outcome and how your claim has been\nprocessed. For Hollard issued policies, all approved benefits\nwill be paid into your nominated bank account or by cheque.\nFor PetSure issued policies, we\u2019ll pay all approved benefits\ninto your nominated bank account.\nWe reserve the right to deduct from the benefit amount any\namount due to us, for example for any overdue premium\npayments.\nNote: In the event that we pay a benefit contrary to the\npolicy terms and conditions for whatever reason, this won\u2019t\nconstitute a waiver of our rights to apply the policy terms\nand conditions retrospectively to any paid claims or to any\nfuture claims for that or any related condition.\nWe also reserve our right to recover from you any benefit\namount received by you as a result of such error.\nDeclining to process your claim\nIf you or your vet refuse to or are unable to provide\ninformation reasonably requested by us to process your\nclaim, we may decline or reduce the amount payable for\nyour claim, in accordance with relevant law.\nFraudulent claims\nIf you submit a fraudulent claim or entice your vet to behave\nin a fraudulent manner regarding a claim, then the claim may\nbe denied or reduced in accordance with relevant law, and\nwe may cancel your policy altogether in the event you make\na fraudulent claim.

Total\nbenefits paid to you across all insurance cannot exceed your\nactual expenses.\nHow we prevent or handle fraud\nUnfortunately, fraud and attempted fraud can occur. We\nemploy sophisticated fraud detection and prevention\ntechniques to ensure we only pay genuine claims. By doing\nthis we\u2019re protecting you and all our policyholders.\nYou must not act in a fraudulent manner. If you or anyone\nacting for you:\n\u2022 makes a claim, submits a document, or makes a\nstatement in support of a claim under the policy\nknowing the claim, document or statement to be false or\nfraudulently exaggerated in any respect;\n\u2022 works with your vet to behave in a fraudulent manner\nregarding a claim, e.g. pressuring your vet to note\nincorrect information; or\n\u2022 makes a claim in respect of any loss or damage caused\nby your willful act or by colluding with another person;\nThen:\n\u2022 we may be entitled to refuse to pay all or part of the\nclaim, to the extent permitted by law;\n\u2022 we may cancel your policy and any other insurance\npolicies you hold with us;\n\u2022 we may be entitled to reclaim any payments already\nmade to you in respect of such claims;\n\u2022 we may not refund a premium already paid; or\n\u2022 we may inform the police of the circumstances and we\nmay take legal action.\n29\n6\nPAYING YOUR\nPREMIUM\nYour insurance policy cover is provided on the basis that\nyou\u2019ve paid or agreed to pay us the premium for that\ncover. The amount you pay is shown on your certificate of\ninsurance. It includes all premium, administration fees and\nany applicable discounts, government taxes, fees and/or\ncharges.\nWe like to think we don\u2019t miss a thing, but if you have a\nquestion about anything on your certificate of insurance,\nplease contact us.\nHow to pay\nYour pet insurance premium is payable when you take out a\nnew policy and subsequently when your policy is renewed.\nPremiums can be paid via direct debit through a credit card\nor bank account:\n\u2022 annually;\nOR\n\u2022 in monthly or fortnightly instalments.\nWhen premiums are paid in monthly or fortnightly\ninstalments, you\u2019ll be charged a collection fee per instalment,\nthe amount of which will be displayed on your certificate of\ninsurance.\nIf we accept and pay a claim under your policy, we may\ndeduct the balance of any outstanding premium from the\nclaim payment.\nPaying on time\nYou need to make sure your premium payment(s) are up to\ndate.

It\u2019s important that you know that neither Hollard\nnor PetSure will be responsible for fees charged by your\nbank or financial institution.\n31\nIf your direct debit fails, we\u2019ll notify you of this and\nautomatically retry for the outstanding amount within\n14 calendar days. Should this second attempt fail, we\u2019ll\ntry again after 14 calendar days and, depending on your\npayment frequency, we\u2019ll deduct either the outstanding\namount, or the outstanding amount together with your\nregular instalment.\nIf you\u2019d like to make a real-time payment of your\noutstanding balance before we reattempt a direct debit, just\ncall us to do this.\nFor payments by direct debit\nFor Hollard issued policies, if the direct debit bank account is\nnot yours, you confirm you have the authority of the account\nholder to use it and that they\u2019ve agreed to these terms.\nFor PetSure issued policies, you must have the sole authority\nas the account holder of the direct debit bank account and\nagree to the Direct Debit Request Service Agreement.\nFor payments by credit card\nIf the credit card is not yours, you confirm you have the\nauthority of the credit card account holder to use it and that\nthey\u2019ve agreed to these terms.\nShould you have questions about the operation of the direct\ndebit authority or you need to change any aspects of the\nauthority, please contact us.\n32\n7\nRENEWALS,\nCANCELLATIONS\n& CHANGES\nThis part of the booklet explains your options for renewing,\ncancelling or changing the cover for your pet insurance\npolicy.\nAnnual renewal of your insurance policy\nAs long as we continue to provide the product, we\u2019ll offer\nrenewal of your policy every year.

It is very important that you do so, as we base\nour decision whether to provide cover and the terms on\nwhich we do so on your answers.\n36\nIf you\u2019re not sure of the answers to any of our questions,\nyou should take the time to find them. It\u2019s also important\nto understand that, in answering the questions, you\u2019re\nanswering for yourself and anyone else to whom the\nquestions apply.\nIf any of our questions aren\u2019t clear and you need help, please\ncontact us.\nWhen this duty applies\nThe duty to take reasonable care not to make a\nmisrepresentation also applies before you renew, vary,\nextend or reinstate an existing contract of insurance. This\nmeans that you must inform us of any changes to the\ninformation set out in your certificate of insurance, where the\ninformation is no longer honest, accurate and complete. If\nyou don\u2019t contact us to update this information, we\u2019ll take it\nthat you agree that the information remains honest, accurate\nand complete. Please contact us if you have any doubts.\nIf you don\u2019t comply with your duty\nIf you don\u2019t take reasonable care in answering our questions\nor inform us of changes to the information set out in\nyour policy documents, you may breach your duty. If that\nhappens, your policy may be cancelled, or treated as if it\nnever existed, and any claim may be denied or not paid in\nfull.\nUpdates to the PDS\nWe may need to update this PDS from time to time when\ncertain changes occur and where we\u2019re required and\npermitted by law to do so. If that happens, we\u2019ll issue you\nwith a new PDS or a Supplementary PDS or other compliant\ndocument to update the relevant information.\nWhere the information isn\u2019t materially adverse from the\npoint of view of a reasonable person considering whether\nto buy or continue to hold this insurance, we may issue you\nwith notice in a different form, including but not limited to\ndisclosure updates on the PetSure and/or\nPetinsurance.com.au website(s).\nYou can contact us to get a free paper copy or download an\nelectronic copy that summarises these changes.\n37\nHow we calculate your premium\nYour premium is calculated when your Petinsurance.com.au\npolicy begins, at each policy anniversary, and also if you vary\nyour cover. The premium for each policy period is printed on\nyour certificate of insurance.\nThe amount you pay also includes allowances for\ngovernment fees, taxes and charges, including stamp duty\nand GST.\nFor new policies\nWe calculate your premium based on several factors. Some\nare pre-set and don\u2019t vary, e.g. amounts we consider for\nsome internal expenses. Others can affect the premium\namount depending on whether we believe it increases or\ndecreases the risk to us. For example, the type of cover and\noptions you have selected.\nWe\u2019ll also take into account risk factors associated with\nyou and your pet such as your pet\u2019s breed and age. For\ninstance, as your pet gets older the risk of your pet requiring\ntreatment will increase and so the premium increases.\nThere are also commercial factors that affect your premium,\nincluding costs associated with operating our business and\nour commercial arrangements.\nYour premium calculation may also include discounts or\npromotional offers that we provide. If you qualify for two or\nmore discounts, we apply a specific order to our calculation\nof your final premium.\nAlso, any discounts and/or your premium may be rounded\nup or down and some may only apply in the first year of\ncoverage.\nFor renewals and changes to your policy\nFor renewals, we also factor in the claim history for your pet\nand the average cost of care for pets like yours, as well as\nthe claims experience across all our insured pets. Because of\nall of these factors and the changes to your pet\u2019s risk profile,\nyour premium will increase from year to year.\nWhen calculating your premium on renewal, we also\nconsider how much your premium was previously, including\nany discounts that may have been applied.

Words that are italicised\nin this booklet have the special meaning explained in this\nsection.\nBenefit limit and Sub-limit(s) means as follows:\nBenefit limit means the applicable maximum amount\npayable by us in any one policy period, for your cover.\nSub-limit(s) means the applicable maximum amount(s)\npayable by us in any one policy period, for particular items,\ntreatments or conditions that you have cover for.\nThe amounts of your benefit limit and sub-limit(s), together\nwith particular items subject to sub-limit(s) are specified on\nyour certificate of insurance.\nAlso note:\n\u2022 we\u2019ll never pay more than the overall annual benefit limit\nor sub-limit specified on your certificate of insurance.\nThis means that if a sub-limit applies for a particular item\nof cover, condition or treatment, we won\u2019t pay more than\nthat amount, either on an individual or per claim basis for\nthat item. This is also subject to the overall benefit limit\nor other relevant sub-limit not having been exceeded.\n\u2022 the benefit limit and sub-limits are reset when you\nrenew your policy. This means that policy benefits don\u2019t\naccumulate across policy periods. They expire at the end\nof each policy period.\n\u2022 the benefit limit and sub-limits are also subject to the\nexcess (if any) applicable to your cover.\nBenefit percentage means the stated percentage of each\nclaim for eligible vet expenses and eligible costs for covered\nitems which we reimburse, subject to the applicable benefit\nlimit or sub-limit and excesses. The applicable benefit\npercentage will be shown on your certificate of insurance.\nNote: The benefit percentage does not apply to routine care\nitems.\n50\nBilateral condition means any condition affecting body parts\non each side of your pet\u2019s body, e.g. ears, eyes, knees or\nelbows.\nA bilateral condition is considered a single condition\nwhen applying a benefit limit, sub-limit, excess (if any) or\nexclusion.\nExample 1: if your pet had elbow dysplasia in the left elbow\nprior to the commencement date of the first policy period or\nduring the applicable waiting period, and this falls within the\ndefinition of a pre-existing condition, a subsequent elbow\ndysplasia in the right elbow will still be considered a pre-\nexisting condition.\nExample 2: if your pet suffers from a patella luxation in its\nleft hind leg and arthritis in its right hind leg, this is not a\nbilateral condition. Patella luxation and arthritis aren\u2019t the\nsame condition.\nCertificate of insurance is the certificate we provide you that\noutlines the key details of the contract of insurance between\nyou and us. It includes the policy number, cover, excess (if\nany), commencement date, end date, insured pet details, and\nthe schedule of benefits, including benefit limits, sub-limits\nand dental illness limit (if applicable).\nNote: A certificate of insurance is issued to you when we\naccept your application for cover, on each renewal, and\nwhenever your policy is amended.\nChronic condition means a long-lasting condition which\nis recurring or present in your pet over a period greater\nthan three months in total, however the three-month\nperiod need not be consecutive. Chronic conditions may\nalso be intermittent or managed with medication and/or\nprescription diets with intervals of remission.\nExamples include (but aren\u2019t limited to): chronic or\nseasonal allergies, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes,\nosteoarthritis, cancer and some autoimmune diseases.\nIf a chronic condition is a pre-existing condition, it will\nalways be excluded from cover. That means, it will never be\nconsidered a temporary condition.\n51\nCommencement date unless otherwise specified, is the date\nwhen cover for your pet started in the current policy period\nas shown on your certificate of insurance. The start time is\n11:59PM on that date.\nNote: Also see the first policy period definition for\ncommencement date of first policy period.\nCondition means any specified accidental injury, or any\nmanifestation of an illness.

This includes meniscal\ntears, any looseness of the cruciate ligaments, along with\nany complications following treatment for this condition.\nDental illness benefit means the dental illness benefit\ndescribed in the \u201cAdditional and optional benefits\u201d section\nwhich provides benefits, up to the dental illness limit, for\neligible vet expenses incurred in relation to specified dental\nconditions.\n52\nDental illness limit means the dental illness limit amount\nspecified on your certificate of insurance, for the dental\nillness benefit, which is applied as follows:\n\u2022 for the Platinum plan, the dental illness limit is a sub-\nlimit subject to your benefit limit. This means that it is\nincluded as part of your overall benefit limit.\n\u2022 for the Gold plan, the dental illness limit is additional to\nyour policy\u2019s benefit limit.\nIf you have the dental illness benefit, also note:\n\u2022 we\u2019ll never pay more than the dental illness limit\nspecified on your certificate of insurance.\n\u2022 the dental illness limit resets if you renew your policy.\nThis means that policy benefits for the dental illness\nbenefit don\u2019t accumulate across policy periods. They\nexpire at the end of each policy period.\n\u2022 the dental illness limit is also subject to the excess (if\nany) applicable to your cover.\nElective treatment means a treatment or surgery that is\nbeneficial to your pet but is not essential for your pet\u2019s\nsurvival and doesn\u2019t form part of the treatment for a covered\ncondition.\nEnd date is the date when your policy terminates. No further\nbenefits or entitlements can be paid under the policy for vet\nexpenses or other claims expenses incurred after the end\ndate. The end time is 11:59PM on that date.\nUnless otherwise specified, this relates to the end date of\nyour current policy period.\nThe end date is shown on your certificate of insurance. If\nthe policy is cancelled, then the date of cancellation will be\ndeemed to be the end date.\nExcess means an amount you contribute towards the cost of\nyour claim(s), as shown on your certificate of insurance. The\nexcess is calculated on a \u2018per condition, per policy period\u2019\nbasis. We do this for each condition treated that is unrelated\nto any other condition during the same policy period.

We\u2019ll then respond\nto you (and your vet if submitted on your behalf) in writing\nwith the outcome. A pre-approval isn\u2019t valid unless we\u2019ve\nagreed to it in writing.\nNote: If we agree to a pre-approval but the treatment\nprovided by your vet differs from the treatment request in\nthe pre-approval, then our assessment of the amount we\ncover under your claim may vary from the notified pre-\napproval amount. A variation in the amount we cover may\nalso occur if you have reached your benefit limit, sub-limit\nor other applicable limit on the claim.\nand calculates your pet insurance claim benefits while you\u2019re\nstill at the vet. If your vet is GapOnly\u00ae enabled, you don\u2019t\nneed to pay your vet in full prior to the submission of your\nclaim. Instead, your vet submits the claim to us electronically\non your behalf and you agree to pay the \u2018gap\u2019 (the difference\nbetween the vet\u2019s invoice and the claim benefit calculated, if\nany, under your policy).\nYou must pay the gap to your treating vet at the time you\nmake a GapOnly\u00ae claim. We\u2019ll then pay the claim benefit (if\nany) directly to your vet.\nYou can find more information on GapOnly\u00ae here: www.\ngaponly.com.au.\nGapOnly\u00ae claim, we\u2019ll pay the claim benefits to you, not your\nvet.\n24\nYou agree that we\u2019re authorised to discuss with your vet, the\ndetails relating to your claim or the treatment provided to\nyour pet in relation to a claim made under your policy. You\nalso agree that your vet is authorised to view the outcome\nof your claim, including the amount of claims benefits.\nPlease note that:\n\u2022 in some instances, we may require more information to\nprocess your claim, such as previous medical history or\npathology/laboratory results. We\u2019ll contact you or your\nvet if required;\n\u2022 there may be situations where we request additional\nveterinary history from current or previous vets, e.g. if\nthere\u2019s a large history gap, to ensure we have all relevant\nclinical information for your pet;\n\u2022 for adopted pets, veterinary history is only required from\nwhen you took ownership. You\u2019ll need to provide us with\nproof of adoption or transfer of ownership papers;\n\u2022 if you\u2019re making an emergency boarding claim, we may\nrequire supporting documentation;\n\u2022 unless we agree otherwise, all of your claims must\ninclude itemised tax invoice(s), payment receipt(s) and\nvet consultation notes if applicable;\n\u2022 incomplete claim forms may result in a processing\ndelay. We recommend that you retain copies of all\ndocumentation for your records;\n\u2022 you also agree that your current or previous vet or any\nother service provider that provided treatments to your\npet is authorised to release information and/or records\nto us about your pet; and\n\u2022 you\u2019re responsible for any fees and expenses that may\nbe charged to you by any third parties relating to the\npurchase and administration of your policy, assistance\nprovided to you to complete any forms and in relation to\nclaims.\nAdjustment of claim payments\nIf the vet expenses incurred by you exceed what is\nreasonable and essential, having regard to other vet\nexpenses in a similar situation, your claim payments may be\nadjusted and paid based on the reasonable and essential\ntreatment or fees typically charged for the treatment, for a\npet in similar circumstances.\n25\nSettlement of your claim\nWe\u2019ll send you a remittance advice regarding the settlement\nof your claim, either by email or letter, depending on your\nchosen means to communicate with us. This advice provides\ndetails of your claim outcome and how your claim has been\nprocessed. For Hollard issued policies, all approved benefits\nwill be paid into your nominated bank account or by cheque.\nFor PetSure issued policies, we\u2019ll pay all approved benefits\ninto your nominated bank account.\nWe reserve the right to deduct from the benefit amount any\namount due to us, for example for any overdue premium\npayments.\nNote: In the event that we pay a benefit contrary to the\npolicy terms and conditions for whatever reason, this won\u2019t\nconstitute a waiver of our rights to apply the policy terms\nand conditions retrospectively to any paid claims or to any\nfuture claims for that or any related condition.\nWe also reserve our right to recover from you any benefit\namount received by you as a result of such error.\nDeclining to process your claim\nIf you or your vet refuse to or are unable to provide\ninformation reasonably requested by us to process your\nclaim, we may decline or reduce the amount payable for\nyour claim, in accordance with relevant law.\nFraudulent claims\nIf you submit a fraudulent claim or entice your vet to behave\nin a fraudulent manner regarding a claim, then the claim may\nbe denied or reduced in accordance with relevant law, and\nwe may cancel your policy altogether in the event you make\na fraudulent claim.

Total\nbenefits paid to you across all insurance cannot exceed your\nactual expenses.\nHow we prevent or handle fraud\nUnfortunately, fraud and attempted fraud can occur. We\nemploy sophisticated fraud detection and prevention\ntechniques to ensure we only pay genuine claims. By doing\nthis we\u2019re protecting you and all our policyholders.\nYou must not act in a fraudulent manner. If you or anyone\nacting for you:\n\u2022 makes a claim, submits a document, or makes a\nstatement in support of a claim under the policy\nknowing the claim, document or statement to be false or\nfraudulently exaggerated in any respect;\n\u2022 works with your vet to behave in a fraudulent manner\nregarding a claim, e.g. pressuring your vet to note\nincorrect information; or\n\u2022 makes a claim in respect of any loss or damage caused\nby your willful act or by colluding with another person;\nThen:\n\u2022 we may be entitled to refuse to pay all or part of the\nclaim, to the extent permitted by law;\n\u2022 we may cancel your policy and any other insurance\npolicies you hold with us;\n\u2022 we may be entitled to reclaim any payments already\nmade to you in respect of such claims;\n\u2022 we may not refund a premium already paid; or\n\u2022 we may inform the police of the circumstances and we\nmay take legal action.\n28\n6\nPAYING YOUR\nPREMIUM\nYour insurance policy cover is provided on the basis that\nyou\u2019ve paid or agreed to pay us the premium for that\ncover. The amount you pay is shown on your certificate of\ninsurance. It includes all premium, administration fees and\nany applicable discounts, government taxes, fees and/or\ncharges.\nWe like to think we don\u2019t miss a thing, but if you have a\nquestion about anything on your certificate of insurance,\nplease contact us.\nHow to pay\nYour pet insurance premium is payable when you take out a\nnew policy and subsequently when your policy is renewed.\nPremiums can be paid via direct debit through a credit card\nor bank account:\n\u2022 annually;\nOR\n\u2022 in monthly or fortnightly instalments.\nWhen premiums are paid in monthly or fortnightly\ninstalments, you\u2019ll be charged a collection fee per instalment,\nthe amount of which will be displayed on your certificate of\ninsurance.\nIf we accept and pay a claim under your policy, we may\ndeduct the balance of any outstanding premium from the\nclaim payment.\nPaying on time\nYou need to make sure your premium payment(s) are up to\ndate. If you have a policy that you\u2019re paying by instalments\nand we haven\u2019t received an instalment payment by its due\ndate, we\u2019ll send you a notice in writing by mail, email or text\nmessage about your non-payment.\nThis will be at least 14 calendar days before any cancellation\nof your policy for non-payment.\n29\nIf we don\u2019t receive the instalment payment after sending this\nnotice, we\u2019ll send you a second notice in writing, again by\nmail, email or text message.\nThis will happen either:\n\u2022 prior to cancellation of your policy, informing you\nthat your instalment policy is being cancelled for non-\npayment if the unpaid premium remains in arrears for\nmore than one month;\nOR\n\u2022 within 14 calendar days after cancellation by us,\nconfirming our cancellation of your instalment policy\nafter the unpaid premium was in arrears for at least one\nmonth.\nIf one or more instalments has remained unpaid for a period\nof at least 14 calendar days, then we reserve the right to\nreduce any claim made on the policy by the amount of any\noutstanding premium.\nCancellation consequences\nIf we cancel your policy due to non-payment of an\ninstalment premium, please be aware that:\n\u2022 no benefits or entitlements can be paid under the policy\nfor vet expenses or other claims expenses incurred after\nthe cancellation date;\n\u2022 you may be refused cover in the future under any policy\nadministered by PetSure; and\n\u2022 any application for general insurance products (with any\nprovider) in the future may be affected because you had\na policy cancelled because of unpaid premiums.\nYour payment account\nWhen you provide us with your nominated credit card or\nbank account details, we use these to directly debit the\npremium calculated by us from that card or account.\nUnless you opt out of automatic renewals or tell us that you\ndon\u2019t want to renew your policy, we\u2019ll deduct/charge the\nrenewal premium from your nominated credit card or bank\naccount.\nIf your premium can\u2019t be paid, e.g. there isn\u2019t enough money\nin your nominated account, you may be charged a fee by\nyour bank. It\u2019s important that you know that neither Hollard\nnor PetSure will be responsible for fees charged by your\nbank or financial institution.\n30\nIf your direct debit fails, we\u2019ll notify you of this and\nautomatically retry for the outstanding amount within\n14 calendar days. Should this second attempt fail, we\u2019ll\ntry again after 14 calendar days and, depending on your\npayment frequency, we\u2019ll deduct either the outstanding\namount, or the outstanding amount together with your\nregular instalment.\nIf you\u2019d like to make a real-time payment of your\noutstanding balance before we reattempt a direct debit, just\ncall us to do this.\nFor payments by direct debit\nFor Hollard issued policies, if the direct debit bank account is\nnot yours, you confirm you have the authority of the account\nholder to use it and that they\u2019ve agreed to these terms.\nFor PetSure issued policies, you must have the sole authority\nas the account holder of the direct debit bank account and\nagree to the Direct Debit Request Service Agreement.\nFor payments by credit card\nIf the credit card is not yours, you confirm you have the\nauthority of the credit card account holder to use it and that\nthey\u2019ve agreed to these terms.\nShould you have questions about the operation of the direct\ndebit authority or you need to change any aspects of the\nauthority, please contact us.\n31\n7\nRENEWALS,\nCANCELLATIONS\n& CHANGES\nThis part of the booklet explains your options for renewing,\ncancelling or changing the cover for your pet insurance\npolicy.\nAnnual renewal of your insurance policy\nAs long as we continue to provide the product, we\u2019ll offer\nrenewal of your policy every year.

It is very important that you do so, as we base\nour decision whether to provide cover and the terms on\nwhich we do so on your answers.\n35\nIf you\u2019re not sure of the answers to any of our questions,\nyou should take the time to find them. It\u2019s also important\nto understand that, in answering the questions, you\u2019re\nanswering for yourself and anyone else to whom the\nquestions apply.\nIf any of our questions aren\u2019t clear and you need help, please\ncontact us.\nWhen this duty applies\nThe duty to take reasonable care not to make a\nmisrepresentation also applies before you renew, vary,\nextend or reinstate an existing contract of insurance. This\nmeans that you must inform us of any changes to the\ninformation set out in your certificate of insurance, where the\ninformation is no longer honest, accurate and complete. If\nyou don\u2019t contact us to update this information, we\u2019ll take it\nthat you agree that the information remains honest, accurate\nand complete. Please contact us if you have any doubts.\nIf you don\u2019t comply with your duty\nIf you don\u2019t take reasonable care in answering our questions\nor inform us of changes to the information set out in\nyour policy documents, you may breach your duty. If that\nhappens, your policy may be cancelled, or treated as if it\nnever existed, and any claim may be denied or not paid in\nfull.\nUpdates to the PDS\nWe may need to update this PDS from time to time when\ncertain changes occur and where we\u2019re required and\npermitted by law to do so. If that happens, we\u2019ll issue you\nwith a new PDS or a Supplementary PDS or other compliant\ndocument to update the relevant information.\nWhere the information isn\u2019t materially adverse from the\npoint of view of a reasonable person considering whether\nto buy or continue to hold this insurance, we may issue you\nwith notice in a different form, including but not limited to\ndisclosure updates on the PetSure and/or\nPetinsurance.com.au website(s).\nYou can contact us to get a free paper copy or download an\nelectronic copy that summarises these changes.\n36\nHow we calculate your premium\nYour premium is calculated when your Petinsurance.com.au\npolicy begins, at each policy anniversary, and also if you vary\nyour cover. The premium for each policy period is printed on\nyour certificate of insurance.\nThe amount you pay also includes allowances for\ngovernment fees, taxes and charges, including stamp duty\nand GST.\nFor new policies\nWe calculate your premium based on several factors. Some\nare pre-set and don\u2019t vary, e.g. amounts we consider for\nsome internal expenses. Others can affect the premium\namount depending on whether we believe it increases or\ndecreases the risk to us. For example, the type of cover and\noptions you have selected.\nWe\u2019ll also take into account risk factors associated with\nyou and your pet such as your pet\u2019s breed and age. For\ninstance, as your pet gets older the risk of your pet requiring\ntreatment will increase and so the premium increases.\nThere are also commercial factors that affect your premium,\nincluding costs associated with operating our business and\nour commercial arrangements.\nYour premium calculation may also include discounts or\npromotional offers that we provide. If you qualify for two or\nmore discounts, we apply a specific order to our calculation\nof your final premium.\nAlso, any discounts and/or your premium may be rounded\nup or down and some may only apply in the first year of\ncoverage.\nFor renewals and changes to your policy\nFor renewals, we also factor in the claim history for your pet\nand the average cost of care for pets like yours, as well as\nthe claims experience across all our insured pets. Because of\nall of these factors and the changes to your pet\u2019s risk profile,\nyour premium will increase from year to year.\nWhen calculating your premium on renewal, we also\nconsider how much your premium was previously, including\nany discounts that may have been applied.

Words that are italicised\nin this booklet have the special meaning explained in this\nsection.\nBenefit limit and Sub-limit(s) means as follows:\nBenefit limit means the applicable maximum amount\npayable by us in any one policy period, for your cover.\nSub-limit(s) means the applicable maximum amount(s)\npayable by us in any one policy period, for particular items,\ntreatments or specified conditions that you have cover for.\nThe amounts of your benefit limit and sub-limit(s), together\nwith particular items subject to sub-limit(s) are specified on\nyour certificate of insurance.\nAlso note:\n\u2022 we\u2019ll never pay more than the overall annual benefit limit\nor sub-limit specified on your certificate of insurance.\nThis means that if a sub-limit applies for a particular\nitem of cover, specified condition or treatment, we won\u2019t\npay more than that amount, either on an individual or\nper claim basis for that item. This is also subject to the\noverall benefit limit or other relevant sub-limit not having\nbeen exceeded.\n\u2022 the benefit limit and sub-limits are reset when you\nrenew your policy. This means that policy benefits don\u2019t\naccumulate across policy periods. They expire at the end\nof each policy period.\n\u2022 the benefit limit and sub-limits are also subject to the\nexcess (if any) applicable to your cover.\n49\nBenefit percentage means the stated percentage of each\nclaim for eligible vet expenses and eligible costs for covered\nitems which we reimburse, subject to the applicable benefit\nlimit or sub-limit and excesses. The applicable benefit\npercentage will be shown on your certificate of insurance.\nNote: The benefit percentage does not apply to routine care\nitems.\nBilateral condition means any condition affecting body parts\non each side of your pet\u2019s body, e.g. ears, eyes, knees or\nelbows.\nA bilateral condition is considered a single condition or\nspecified condition when applying a benefit limit, sub-limit,\nexcess (if any) or exclusion.\nExample 1: if your pet had an ear infection in the left ear\nprior to the commencement date of the first policy period\nor during the applicable waiting period, and this falls within\nthe definition of a pre-existing condition, a subsequent ear\ninfection in the right ear will still be considered a pre-existing\ncondition.\nExample 2: if your pet suffers from a patella luxation in its\nleft hind leg and arthritis in its right hind leg, this is not a\nbilateral condition. Patella luxations and arthritis aren\u2019t the\nsame condition.\nCancer means a condition in which any cell or group of cells\nin the body of your pet undergoes malignant transformation.\nCertificate of insurance is the certificate we provide you that\noutlines the key details of the contract of insurance between\nyou and us. It includes the policy number, cover, excess (if\nany), commencement date, end date, insured pet details, and\nthe schedule of benefits, including benefit limits, sub-limits\nand dental illness limit (if applicable).\nNote: A certificate of insurance is issued to you when we\naccept your application for cover, on each renewal, and\nwhenever your policy is amended.\nChronic condition means a long-lasting condition which\nis recurring or present in your pet over a period greater\nthan three months in total, however the three-month\nperiod need not be consecutive. Chronic conditions may\nalso be intermittent or managed with medication and/or\nprescription diets with intervals of remission.\n50\nExamples include (but aren\u2019t limited to): chronic or\nseasonal allergies, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes,\nosteoarthritis, cancer and some autoimmune diseases.\nIf a chronic condition is a pre-existing condition, it will\nalways be excluded from cover. That means, it will never be\nconsidered a temporary condition.\nCommencement date unless otherwise specified, is the date\nwhen cover for your pet started in the current policy period\nas shown on your certificate of insurance. The start time is\n11:59PM on that date.\nNote: Also see the first policy period definition for\ncommencement date of first policy period.\nCondition means a condition resulting from an accidental\ninjury or manifestation of an illness.\nNote: Only conditions that are specified conditions, and/or\nspecified dental conditions (where covered under the dental\nillness benefit) are eligible for cover under your policy. See\ndefinition of a specified condition.\nConsultation and other derivations means an examination\nperformed by or under the supervision of a vet, including\na physical consultation, inpatient examination, in-hospital\nexamination, health certificate, consultation or recheck\nconsultation/visit, referral/specialist consultation/visits,\nphone consultation, web consultation and emergency and\nafter-hours consultations/visits.\nNote: Any applicable sub-limit will be shown on your\ncertificate of insurance.\nCover means:\n\u2022 the benefit limit, sub-limits, excess (if any), benefit\npercentage and any other optional or additional benefits\n(including their limits) applicable to your selected policy;\nand\n\u2022 the cover applicable under your policy for your selected\nplan and any previous policies you\u2019ve held with us where\nthe same or a substantially similar or a higher level of\ncover was provided in the current policy period, without\nany break or time without holding the cover.\nNote: The cover for the Bronze Cover for Indoor Cat plan\ncomprises of specified conditions cover, the additional\nbenefits and if selected, the optional benefits.\n51\nDental illness benefit means the dental illness benefit\ndescribed in the \u201cAdditional and optional benefits\u201d section\nwhich provides benefits, up to the dental illness limit, for\neligible vet expenses incurred in relation to specified dental\nconditions.\nDental illness limit means the dental illness limit amount\nspecified on your certificate of insurance, for the dental\nillness benefit.\nIf you have the dental illness benefit, note:\n\u2022 we\u2019ll never pay more than the dental illness limit\nspecified on your certificate of insurance.\n\u2022 the dental illness limit resets if you renew your policy.\nThis means that policy benefits for the dental illness\nbenefit don\u2019t accumulate across policy periods. They\nexpire at the end of each policy period.\n\u2022 the dental illness limit is also subject to the excess (if\nany) applicable to your cover.\nElective treatment means a treatment or surgery that is\nbeneficial to your pet but is not essential for your pet\u2019s\nsurvival and doesn\u2019t form part of the treatment for a covered\nspecified condition and/or specified dental condition.\nEnd date is the date when your policy terminates. No further\nbenefits or entitlements can be paid under the policy for vet\nexpenses or other claims expenses incurred after the end\ndate. The end time is 11:59PM on that date.\nUnless otherwise specified, this relates to the end date of\nyour current policy period.\nThe end date is shown on your certificate of insurance. If\nthe policy is cancelled, then the date of cancellation will be\ndeemed to be the end date.\nExcess means an amount you contribute towards the cost of\nyour claim(s), as shown on your certificate of insurance. The\nexcess is calculated on a \u2018per condition, per policy period\u2019\nbasis. We do this for each condition treated that is unrelated\nto any other condition during the same policy period. Your\nexcess also applies to each emergency boarding claim event.\nThe excess will be deducted from your calculated claim\nbenefits after we apply any benefit limit, sub-limit and the\nbenefit percentage to your claimed amount.\nPet means the cat covered under the policy and named on\nyour certificate of insurance.\nPolicy period means the time during which we provide cover\nas specified on your certificate of insurance.\nNote: Unless otherwise specified, this relates to your current\npolicy period.\nPre-existing condition means a condition that first existed or\noccurred:\n\u2022 prior to the commencement date of the first policy\nperiod; or\n\u2022 within any applicable waiting period; AND\n\u2022 of which you were aware of, or a reasonable person in\nyour circumstances would have been aware, irrespective\nof whether the underlying or causative condition has\nbeen diagnosed.\nA pre-existing condition also includes a related condition or\nbilateral condition of a pre-existing condition.\nRelated condition means a condition that results from the\nsame disease process, arises as a consequence of or has\nthe same diagnostic classification as another condition,\nregardless of the number of areas of your pet\u2019s body that\nare affected.\nExamples\n\u2022 if your pet suffers from arthritis in its leg, all future\noccurrences of arthritis, e.g. in the back or neck, will be\nrelated conditions.\n\u2022 if your pet suffers from diabetes and then develops a\ncataract as a consequence of the diabetes, the cataract\nwill then be a related condition.\nRoutine care means certain pet care items for your pet listed\non your certificate of insurance which are non-insurance\nbenefits.

We\u2019ll then respond\nto you (and your vet if submitted on your behalf) in writing\nwith the outcome. A pre-approval isn\u2019t valid unless we\u2019ve\nagreed to it in writing.\nNote: If we agree to a pre-approval but the treatment\nprovided by your vet differs from the treatment request in\nthe pre-approval, then our assessment of the amount we\ncover under your claim may vary from the notified pre-\napproval amount.

We\u2019ll contact you or your\nvet if required;\n\u2022 there may be situations where we request additional\nveterinary history from current or previous vets, e.g. if\nthere\u2019s a large history gap, to ensure we have all relevant\nclinical information for your pet;\n\u2022 for adopted pets, veterinary history is only required from\nwhen you took ownership. You\u2019ll need to provide us with\nproof of adoption or transfer of ownership papers;\n\u2022 if you\u2019re making an emergency boarding claim, we may\nrequire supporting documentation;\n\u2022 unless we agree otherwise, all of your claims must\ninclude itemised tax invoice(s), payment receipt(s) and\nvet consultation notes if applicable;\n\u2022 incomplete claim forms may result in a processing\ndelay.

For Hollard issued policies, all approved benefits\nwill be paid into your nominated bank account or by cheque.\nFor PetSure issued policies, we\u2019ll pay all approved benefits\ninto your nominated bank account.\nWe reserve the right to deduct from the benefit amount any\namount due to us, for example for any overdue premium\npayments.\nNote: In the event that we pay a benefit contrary to the\npolicy terms and conditions for whatever reason, this won\u2019t\nconstitute a waiver of our rights to apply the policy terms\nand conditions retrospectively to any paid claims or to any\nfuture claims for that or any related condition.\nWe also reserve our right to recover from you any benefit\namount received by you as a result of such error.\nDeclining to process your claim\nIf you or your vet refuse to or are unable to provide\ninformation reasonably requested by us to process your\nclaim, we may decline or reduce the amount payable for\nyour claim, in accordance with relevant law.\nFraudulent claims\nIf you submit a fraudulent claim or entice your vet to behave\nin a fraudulent manner regarding a claim, then the claim may\nbe denied or reduced in accordance with relevant law, and\nwe may cancel your policy altogether in the event you make\na fraudulent claim.

Total\nbenefits paid to you across all insurance cannot exceed your\nactual expenses.\nHow we prevent or handle fraud\nUnfortunately, fraud and attempted fraud can occur.

The amount you pay is shown on your certificate of\ninsurance. It includes all premium, administration fees and\nany applicable discounts, government taxes, fees and/or\ncharges.\nWe like to think we don\u2019t miss a thing, but if you have a\nquestion about anything on your certificate of insurance,\nplease contact us.\nHow to pay\nYour pet insurance premium is payable when you take out a\nnew policy and subsequently when your policy is renewed.\nPremiums can be paid via direct debit through a credit card\nor bank account:\n\u2022 annually;\nOR\n\u2022 in monthly or fortnightly instalments.\nWhen premiums are paid in monthly or fortnightly\ninstalments, you\u2019ll be charged a collection fee per instalment,\nthe amount of which will be displayed on your certificate of\ninsurance.\nIf we accept and pay a claim under your policy, we may\ndeduct the balance of any outstanding premium from the\nclaim payment.\nPaying on time\nYou need to make sure your premium payment(s) are up to\ndate. If you have a policy that you\u2019re paying by instalments\nand we haven\u2019t received an instalment payment by its due\ndate, we\u2019ll send you a notice in writing by mail, email or text\nmessage about your non-payment.\nThis will be at least 14 calendar days before any cancellation\nof your policy for non-payment.\n31\nIf we don\u2019t receive the instalment payment after sending this\nnotice, we\u2019ll send you a second notice in writing, again by\nmail, email or text message.\nThis will happen either:\n\u2022 prior to cancellation of your policy, informing you\nthat your instalment policy is being cancelled for non-\npayment if the unpaid premium remains in arrears for\nmore than one month;\nOR\n\u2022 within 14 calendar days after cancellation by us,\nconfirming our cancellation of your instalment policy\nafter the unpaid premium was in arrears for at least one\nmonth.\nIf one or more instalments has remained unpaid for a period\nof at least 14 calendar days, then we reserve the right to\nreduce any claim made on the policy by the amount of any\noutstanding premium.\nCancellation consequences\nIf we cancel your policy due to non-payment of an\ninstalment premium, please be aware that:\n\u2022 no benefits or entitlements can be paid under the policy\nfor vet expenses or other claims expenses incurred after\nthe cancellation date;\n\u2022 you may be refused cover in the future under any policy\nadministered by PetSure; and\n\u2022 any application for general insurance products (with any\nprovider) in the future may be affected because you had\na policy cancelled because of unpaid premiums.\n32\nYour payment account\nWhen you provide us with your nominated credit card or\nbank account details, we use these to directly debit the\npremium calculated by us from that card or account.\nUnless you opt out of automatic renewals or tell us that you\ndon\u2019t want to renew your policy, we\u2019ll deduct/charge the\nrenewal premium from your nominated credit card or bank\naccount.\nIf your premium can\u2019t be paid, e.g. there isn\u2019t enough money\nin your nominated account, you may be charged a fee by\nyour bank. It\u2019s important that you know that neither Hollard\nnor PetSure will be responsible for fees charged by your\nbank or financial institution.\nIf your direct debit fails, we\u2019ll notify you of this and\nautomatically retry for the outstanding amount within\n14 calendar days. Should this second attempt fail, we\u2019ll\ntry again after 14 calendar days and, depending on your\npayment frequency, we\u2019ll deduct either the outstanding\namount, or the outstanding amount together with your\nregular instalment.\nIf you\u2019d like to make a real-time payment of your\noutstanding balance before we reattempt a direct debit, just\ncall us to do this.\nFor payments by direct debit\nFor Hollard issued policies, if the direct debit bank account is\nnot yours, you confirm you have the authority of the account\nholder to use it and that they\u2019ve agreed to these terms.\nFor PetSure issued policies, you must have the sole authority\nas the account holder of the direct debit bank account and\nagree to the Direct Debit Request Service Agreement.\nFor payments by credit card\nIf the credit card is not yours, you confirm you have the\nauthority of the credit card account holder to use it and that\nthey\u2019ve agreed to these terms.\nShould you have questions about the operation of the direct\ndebit authority or you need to change any aspects of the\nauthority, please contact us.\n33\n7\nRENEWALS,\nCANCELLATIONS\n& CHANGES\nThis part of the booklet explains your options for renewing,\ncancelling or changing the cover for your pet insurance\npolicy.\nAnnual renewal of your insurance policy\nAs long as we continue to provide the product, we\u2019ll offer\nrenewal of your policy every year. This will be subject to the\napplicable terms and conditions of the policy for each policy\nperiod. We\u2019ll change the premium and may change the terms\nand conditions of the policy at the time of renewal, based on\na combination of factors, including the risk associated with\ninsuring pets like yours.\nRenewal procedure\nWhere we offer renewal of your policy, at least 14 days\nbefore your current policy expires, we\u2019ll send you an offer\nof renewal confirming the expiry date of your policy, and\nthe premium and terms on which we\u2019ll offer to renew your\ninsurance for the next policy period.\nUnless you\u2019ve chosen not to automatically renew your policy,\nyour policy will automatically renew on those terms. Where\nyou have opted-out of automatic renewal, you\u2019ll need to\ncontact us after you\u2019ve received your offer of renewal if\nyou\u2019d like to renew your policy.\nThe notice will also remind you:\n\u2022 that you can opt out of the automatic renewal process at\nany time in the future;\n\u2022 to check the information we have on your certificate of\ninsurance is correct; and\n\u2022 to review your insurance cover to consider if the policy\nlimits and level of cover are still right for you.\n34\nUnless you opt out of automatic renewals or tell us that you\ndon\u2019t want to renew your policy, we\u2019ll deduct/charge the\nrenewal premium from your nominated account or credit\ncard. See the \u201cYour payment account\u201d section for more\ninformation.\nYour premium\nEvery year, we\u2019ll notify you of the changes to your annual\npremium. We review the cost of everyone\u2019s insurance, taking\naccount of a range of factors. These are set out under the\n\u201cHow we calculate your premium\u201d section.\nCancellation by you\nYou can cancel your policy with us at any time by contacting\nour customer service team. Our \u201dContact details\u201d are on the\nlast page of this booklet.\nThe cancellation will be effective once we provide you with\na written confirmation of your request, either by email or\nletter.\nPaying annually?\nIf you\u2019ve been paying your premiums annually, we\u2019ll retain a\nportion of the premium that relates to the period that you\u2019ve\nbeen insured. We\u2019ll refund you the residual premium for the\nunexpired period (less any government or statutory charges\nthat apply). We call this providing you a pro-rata refund,\nbased on the number of days we insured you.\nPaying by instalment?\nIf you\u2019ve been paying your premiums by instalment, there\u2019s\nno premium refund for any remaining days of a current\ninstalment period. No further premium instalments will be\ndeducted.\nIf your pet passes away\nWe know there is a lot going on when your pet passes away,\nbut we\u2019re here to help. Please contact us as soon as possible\nand we\u2019ll cancel your policy from the date of your pet\npassing. We\u2019ll adjust the premium, as outlined above.\nYour cancellation rights during the cooling off period\nYour cooling off cancellation rights apply when you buy\nyour policy and also exist when your policy renews or is\nreissued following a change in your cover. You can find more\ninformation in the \u201cCooling off period\u201d section.\n35\nCancellation by us\nWe may cancel your policy where permitted by and in\naccordance with the law. We\u2019ll give you notice in writing\nbefore exercising any right to cancel your policy. For\nexample, if you:\n\u2022 do not comply with the policy terms and conditions;\n\u2022 do not pay your premium as agreed;\n\u2022 make a fraudulent claim; or\n\u2022 did not comply with your duty to take reasonable care\nnot to make a misrepresentation.\nIf we cancel your policy, we\u2019ll retain and/or refund any\npremium as the law allows us to do so.\nChanging your cover\nYou can change the cover for your pet by choosing cover\nwith different or additional benefits, where eligible and\navailable to you. You may, for example, want a different\nbenefit percentage or benefit limit, or to upgrade your\ncoverage.\nIf you haven\u2019t had a claim paid and want to change your\ncover, just contact us and we\u2019ll issue you a new policy\nnumber and certificate of insurance outlining your new\npremium and your previous policy number will be cancelled.\nHowever, you can\u2019t change your cover if a claim has been\npaid during your current policy period. You\u2019ll need to wait\nuntil your next policy renewal.\nWaiting periods already completed won\u2019t be reapplied\nunless there has been a break or lapse in your cover. If you\nchange the Petinsurance.com.au product you have for your\npet, with a different level of cover, waiting periods will only\napply to any conditions covered by the new product that\nweren\u2019t covered under your previous product.\n36\n8\nOTHER\nIMPORTANT\nINFORMATION\nThis section includes other important information on how\nwe communicate with you, your duty to take reasonable\ncare not to make a misrepresentation, how we calculate your\npremium and more.\nDelivery of your policy documents\nUnless you instruct us otherwise, we prefer to send your\npolicy documents and communicate with you electronically.\nWhere you\u2019ve agreed to receive electronic communications,\nyou\u2019ll need to provide us with your email address and mobile\nnumber.\nWhen we send your policy documents by email, we\u2019ll\nconsider that you have received them on the date recorded\non our information system.\nYou can instruct us to provide these documents by post, to a\nmailing address you provide, either when you purchase your\npolicy or at any time by contacting us.\nYou\u2019re responsible for making sure the email and postal\naddresses you\u2019ve given us are correct and up-to-date at all\ntimes.\nYour duty to take reasonable care not to make a\nmisrepresentation\nBefore you enter into this contract of insurance with us,\nyou have a duty to take reasonable care not to make a\nmisrepresentation under the Insurance Contracts Act 1984\n(Cth).\nThis means you need to take reasonable care to provide\nhonest, accurate and complete answers to any questions\nthat we ask. It is very important that you do so, as we base\nour decision whether to provide cover and the terms on\nwhich we do so on your answers.\n37\nIf you\u2019re not sure of the answers to any of our questions,\nyou should take the time to find them. It\u2019s also important\nto understand that, in answering the questions, you\u2019re\nanswering for yourself and anyone else to whom the\nquestions apply.\nIf any of our questions aren\u2019t clear and you need help, please\ncontact us.\nWhen this duty applies\nThe duty to take reasonable care not to make a\nmisrepresentation also applies before you renew, vary,\nextend or reinstate an existing contract of insurance. This\nmeans that you must inform us of any changes to the\ninformation set out in your certificate of insurance, where the\ninformation is no longer honest, accurate and complete. If\nyou don\u2019t contact us to update this information, we\u2019ll take it\nthat you agree that the information remains honest, accurate\nand complete. Please contact us if you have any doubts.\nIf you don\u2019t comply with your duty\nIf you don\u2019t take reasonable care in answering our questions\nor inform us of changes to the information set out in\nyour policy documents, you may breach your duty. If that\nhappens, your policy may be cancelled, or treated as if it\nnever existed, and any claim may be denied or not paid in\nfull.\nUpdates to the PDS\nWe may need to update this PDS from time to time when\ncertain changes occur and where we\u2019re required and\npermitted by law to do so. If that happens, we\u2019ll issue you\nwith a new PDS or a Supplementary PDS or other compliant\ndocument to update the relevant information.\nWhere the information isn\u2019t materially adverse from the\npoint of view of a reasonable person considering whether\nto buy or continue to hold this insurance, we may issue you\nwith notice in a different form, including but not limited to\ndisclosure updates on the PetSure and/or\nPetinsurance.com.au website(s).\nYou can contact us to get a free paper copy or download an\nelectronic copy that summarises these changes.\nHow we calculate your premium\nYour premium is calculated when your Petinsurance.com.au\npolicy begins, at each policy anniversary, and also if you vary\nyour cover. The premium for each policy period is printed on\nyour certificate of insurance.\n38\nThe amount you pay also includes allowances for\ngovernment fees, taxes and charges, including stamp duty\nand GST.\nFor new policies\nWe calculate your premium based on several factors. Some\nare pre-set and don\u2019t vary, e.g. amounts we consider for\nsome internal expenses. Others can affect the premium\namount depending on whether we believe it increases or\ndecreases the risk to us. For example, the type of cover and\noptions you have selected.\nWe\u2019ll also take into account risk factors associated with\nyou and your pet such as your pet\u2019s breed and age. For\ninstance, as your pet gets older the risk of your pet requiring\ntreatment will increase and so the premium increases.\nThere are also commercial factors that affect your premium,\nincluding costs associated with operating our business and\nour commercial arrangements.\nYour premium calculation may also include discounts or\npromotional offers that we provide. If you qualify for two or\nmore discounts, we apply a specific order to our calculation\nof your final premium.\nAlso, any discounts and/or your premium may be rounded\nup or down and some may only apply in the first year of\ncoverage.\nFor renewals and changes to your policy\nFor renewals, we also factor in the claim history for your pet\nand the average cost of care for pets like yours, as well as\nthe claims experience across all our insured pets. Because of\nall of these factors and the changes to your pet\u2019s risk profile,\nyour premium will increase from year to year.\nWhen calculating your premium on renewal, we also\nconsider how much your premium was previously, including\nany discounts that may have been applied. This means that\nwe may limit movements up or down.\nThese same factors and others are also used to calculate\nyour premium if you amend your coverage.\nFor information about how and when to pay your premium,\nplease read the \u201cPaying your premium\u201d section.\n39\nCooling off period\nYou have a 30 day period to ensure you\u2019re happy with every\naspect of your policy.\nDuring this time, you can contact us and cancel your policy.\nIf we receive your request to cancel your policy within the\n30 day period after the policy commencement date or\nrenewal date and as long as you\u2019ve not made a claim or\nintend to make a claim, we\u2019ll give you a refund of any monies\nreceived since that date. We may also deduct any taxes or\nduties that we\u2019re unable to refund.\nIf you\u2019ve made a claim during the cooling off period and\nwish to cancel your policy, then any refund will be in\naccordance with provisions set out in the \u201cCancellation by\nyou\u201d section.\nAfter the cooling off period ends, you\u2019ll still be able to cancel\nyour policy and you have rights upon cancellation in certain\ncircumstances under the policy. See the \u201cCancellation by\nyou\u201d section for more information.\n40\nYour privacy\nRenewals of Petinsurance.com.au policies first issued before\n7 November 2023\nHollard, PIPL and PetSure (each a \u2018Recipient\u2019 and referred\nto as \u2018we\u2019, \u2018us\u2019 or \u2018our\u2019 in this Privacy section) are subject to\nthe Australian Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act 1988\n(Cth).\nAll other Petinsurance.com.au policies\nPIPL and PetSure (each a \u2018Recipient\u2019 and referred to as\n\u2018we\u2019, \u2018us\u2019 or \u2018our\u2019 in this Privacy section) are subject to the\nAustralian Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act 1988\n(Cth).\nIn connection with each Recipient:\n\u2022 personal information is collected in various ways,\nincluding via telephone, our website, hard copy forms\nor email.

Words that are italicised\nin this booklet have the special meaning explained in this\nsection.\nBenefit limit and Sub-limit(s) means as follows:\nBenefit limit means the applicable maximum amount\npayable by us in any one policy period, for your cover.\nSub-limit(s) means the applicable maximum amount(s)\npayable by us in any one policy period, for particular items,\ntreatments or conditions that you have cover for.\nThe amounts of your benefit limit and sub-limit(s), together\nwith particular items subject to sub-limit(s) are specified on\nyour certificate of insurance.\nAlso note:\n\u2022 we\u2019ll never pay more than the overall annual benefit limit\nor sub-limit specified on your certificate of insurance.\nThis means that if a sub-limit applies for a particular item\nof cover, condition or treatment, we won\u2019t pay more than\nthat amount, either on an individual or per claim basis for\nthat item. This is also subject to the overall benefit limit\nor other relevant sub-limit not having been exceeded.\n\u2022 the benefit limit and sub-limits are reset when you\nrenew your policy. This means that policy benefits don\u2019t\naccumulate across policy periods. They expire at the end\nof each policy period.\n\u2022 the benefit limit and sub-limits are also subject to the\nexcess (if any) applicable to your cover.\n51\nBenefit percentage means the stated percentage of each\nclaim for eligible vet expenses and eligible costs for covered\nitems which we reimburse, subject to the applicable benefit\nlimit or sub-limit and excesses. The applicable benefit\npercentage will be shown on your certificate of insurance.\nNote: The benefit percentage does not apply to routine care\nitems.\nBilateral condition means any condition affecting body parts\non each side of your pet\u2019s body, e.g. ears, eyes, knees or\nelbows.\nA bilateral condition is considered a single condition\nwhen applying a benefit limit, sub-limit, excess (if any) or\nexclusion.\nExample 1: if your pet displays signs or symptoms of a\ncruciate ligament condition in the left knee prior to the\ncommencement date of the first policy period or during the\napplicable waiting period, and this falls within the definition\nof a pre-existing condition, a subsequent cruciate ligament\ncondition in the right knee will still be considered a pre-\nexisting condition.\nExample 2: if your pet suffers from a cruciate ligament\ncondition in its left hind leg and patella luxation in its right\nhind leg, this is not a bilateral condition. Cruciate ligament\nconditions and patella luxation aren\u2019t the same condition.\nCertificate of insurance is the certificate we provide you that\noutlines the key details of the contract of insurance between\nyou and us. It includes the policy number, cover, excess (if\nany), commencement date, end date, insured pet details, and\nthe schedule of benefits, including benefit limits, sub-limits\nand dental illness limit (if applicable).\nNote: A certificate of insurance is issued to you when we\naccept your application for cover, on each renewal, and\nwhenever your policy is amended.\nChronic condition means a long-lasting condition which\nis recurring or present in your pet over a period greater\nthan three months in total, however the three-month\nperiod need not be consecutive. Chronic conditions may\nalso be intermittent or managed with medication and/or\nprescription diets with intervals of remission.\n52\nExamples include (but aren\u2019t limited to): chronic or\nseasonal allergies, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes,\nosteoarthritis, cancer and some autoimmune diseases.\nIf a chronic condition is a pre-existing condition, it will\nalways be excluded from cover. That means, it will never be\nconsidered a temporary condition.\nCommencement date unless otherwise specified, is the date\nwhen cover for your pet started in the current policy period\nas shown on your certificate of insurance. The start time is\n11:59PM on that date.\nNote: Also see the first policy period definition for\ncommencement date of first policy period.\nCondition means a condition resulting from an accidental\ninjury or manifestation of an illness.\nNote: Only conditions that are specified accidental injuries,\nspecified illnesses and/or specified dental conditions (where\ncovered under the dental illness benefit) are eligible for\ncover under your policy.\nConsultation and other derivations means an examination\nperformed by or under the supervision of a vet, including\na physical consultation, inpatient examination, in-hospital\nexamination, health certificate, consultation or recheck\nconsultation/visit, referral/specialist consultation/visits,\nphone consultation, web consultation and emergency and\nafter-hours consultations/visits.\nNote: Any applicable sub-limit will be shown on your\ncertificate of insurance.\nCover means:\n\u2022 the benefit limit, sub-limits, excess (if any), benefit\npercentage and any other optional or additional benefits\n(including their limits) applicable to your selected policy;\nand\n\u2022 the cover applicable under your policy for your selected\nplan and any previous policies you\u2019ve held with us where\nthe same or a substantially similar or a higher level of\ncover was provided in the current policy period, without\nany break or time without holding the cover.\nNote: Your certificate of insurance tells you which plan\nyou have. The cover for your plan comprises of specified\naccidental injury cover, specified illness cover, additional\nbenefits and any selected optional benefits.\n53\nCruciate ligament condition means partial or complete\nrupture of the cruciate ligament(s). This includes meniscal\ntears, any looseness of the cruciate ligaments, along with\nany complications following treatment for this condition.\nDental illness benefit means the dental illness benefit\ndescribed in the \u201cAdditional and optional benefits\u201d section\nwhich provides benefits, up to the dental illness limit, for\neligible vet expenses incurred in relation to specified dental\nconditions.\nDental illness limit means the dental illness limit amount\nspecified on your certificate of insurance which is additional\nto your policy\u2019s benefit limit.\nIf you have the dental illness benefit, also note:\n\u2022 we\u2019ll never pay more than the dental illness limit\nspecified on your certificate of insurance.\n\u2022 the dental illness limit resets if you renew your policy.\nThis means that policy benefits for the dental illness\nbenefit don\u2019t accumulate across policy periods. They\nexpire at the end of each policy period.\n\u2022 the dental illness limit is also subject to the excess (if\nany) applicable to your cover.\nElective treatment means a treatment or surgery that is\nbeneficial to your pet but is not essential for your pet\u2019s\nsurvival and doesn\u2019t form part of the treatment for a covered\ncondition.\nEnd date is the date when your policy terminates. No further\nbenefits or entitlements can be paid under the policy for vet\nexpenses or other claims expenses incurred after the end\ndate. The end time is 11:59PM on that date.\nUnless otherwise specified, this relates to the end date of\nyour current policy period.\nThe end date is shown on your certificate of insurance. If\nthe policy is cancelled, then the date of cancellation will be\ndeemed to be the end date.\n54\nExcess means an amount you contribute towards the cost of\nyour claim(s), as shown on your certificate of insurance. The\nexcess is calculated on a \u2018per condition, per policy period\u2019\nbasis. We do this for each condition treated that is unrelated\nto any other condition during the same policy period. Your\nexcess also applies to each emergency boarding claim event.\nThe excess will be deducted from your calculated claim\nbenefits after we apply any benefit limit, sub-limit and the\nbenefit percentage to your claimed amount.\nPet means the dog or cat covered under the policy and\nnamed on your certificate of insurance.\nPolicy period means the time during which we provide cover\nas specified on your certificate of insurance.\nNote: Unless otherwise specified, this relates to your current\npolicy period.\n55\nPre-existing condition means a condition that first existed or\noccurred:\n\u2022 prior to the commencement date of the first policy\nperiod; or\n\u2022 within any applicable waiting period; AND\n\u2022 of which you were aware of, or a reasonable person in\nyour circumstances would have been aware, irrespective\nof whether the underlying or causative condition has\nbeen diagnosed.\nA pre-existing condition also includes a related condition or\nbilateral condition of a pre-existing condition.\nRelated condition means a condition that results from the\nsame disease process, arises as a consequence of or has\nthe same diagnostic classification as another condition,\nregardless of the number of areas of your pet\u2019s body that\nare affected.\nExamples\n\u2022 if your pet suffers from IVDD on its thoracic region, all\nfuture occurrences of IVDD, e.g. in the lumbar region, will\nbe related conditions.\n\u2022 if your pet suffers from anaphylaxis from a bee sting, all\nfuture occurrences of anaphylaxis from bee stings will\nthen be related conditions.\n\u2022 if your pet suffers from a heatstroke, then later suffers\nfrom thermal burns from a hot water spill, these aren\u2019t\nrelated conditions, as the thermal burns are not as a\nconsequence of the heatstroke, nor do they follow the\nsame disease process or diagnostic classification.\nRoutine care means certain pet care items for your pet listed\non your certificate of insurance which are non-insurance\nbenefits. If you have these benefits, the list of allowable\nitems and the maximum amount payable during the policy\nperiod, are shown on your certificate of insurance.\n56\nSpecified accidental injury means physical harm or injury\narising from at least one of the following:\n\u2022 a motor vehicle incident;\n\u2022 a burn or electrocution;\n\u2022 a reaction to a bite from an insect, spider or scorpion\n(excluding fleas);\n\u2022 a near drowning incident;\nOR\nthe specified accidental injury must be one of the following:\n\u2022 a bone fracture;\n\u2022 a traumatic tooth fracture;\n\u2022 snake bite toxicity;\n\u2022 poisoning;\n\u2022 ingestion of a foreign object;\n\u2022 a traumatic ligament or tendon injury;\n\u2022 a bite wound or fight wound abscesses;\n\u2022 lacerations or abrasion of tissue, skin or mucous\nmembrane due to external trauma; or\n\u2022 a cruciate ligament condition.\nNote: We define an accident as a single unexpected event\nthat is unintended by you and is independent of any illness\nor specified dental condition. For more information, see the\n\u201cSpecified accidental injury cover\u201d section.\nSpecified dental condition means a specified condition\nlisted in the \u201cDental illness benefit\u201d section.\nSpecified illness means the following specified illnesses that\nare a consequence of or result in one of the following:\n\u2022 tick paralysis;\n\u2022 heat stroke;\n\u2022 gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV);\n\u2022 trauma induced respiratory impairment (for example, if\nyour pet chokes or experiences near drowning);\n\u2022 intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) or a traumatic spinal\ndisc rupture;\n\u2022 torn nail;\n\u2022 embedded grass seed;\n\u2022 soft tissue injury; or\n\u2022 eye trauma.\n57\nTemporary condition means a condition that normally\nresolves with treatment, but does not include:\n\u2022 cruciate ligament conditions;\n\u2022 intervertebral disc disease; and\n\u2022 any chronic condition.\nNote: This definition is relevant to determining whether a\ncondition is no longer excluded as a pre-existing condition.\nSee the \u201cPre-existing conditions\u201d section under General\nexisting condition and therefore would be covered, subject\nto your policy terms and conditions.\nTreatment means reasonable and customary treatment\nincluding hospitalisation, surgery, x-rays, medication,\ndiagnostic tests, nursing and other care and procedures\nincluding consultations provided by a vet to relieve or cure\na specified accidental injury, specified illness or specified\ndental condition (where covered) during the policy period.\nVet means any veterinarian, veterinary specialist, animal\nhospital, animal clinic, or animal surgery, other than yourself,\nwho is licensed in and currently registered in Australia.\nVet expenses means the reasonable and essential expenses\nincurred in respect of treatment provided by a vet during the\npolicy period, considering the circumstances in which the\ntreatment was provided.\nWaiting period means the period that your pet is not\ncovered as specified in the Waiting periods section of this\nbooklet, and starts from the commencement date of your\nfirst policy period in which you obtained cover for the\napplicable condition or benefit.\nNote: For more information, see the \u201cWaiting periods\u201d\nsection.\n58\nCONTACT\nDETAILS\nPetinsurance.com.au\nGeneral enquiries, pre-approvals, etc.\nPhone: 1300 855 663\nMonday to Friday 8:00AM to 8:00PM\n(except public holidays)\nEmail: petinsurance@petsure.com.au\nMail: Petinsurance.com.au\nLocked Bag 9021, Castle Hill, NSW 1765\nWebsite: www.petinsurance.com.au\nPrivacy enquiries\nPhone: 1300 855 663\nMonday to Friday 8:00AM to 8:00PM\n(except public holidays)\nEmail: privacy@petinsurance.com.au\nMail: Petinsurance.com.au\nLocked Bag 9021, Castle Hill, NSW 1765\nWebsite: www.petinsurance.com.au\nComplaints\nPhone: 1300 855 663\nMonday to Friday 8:00AM to 8:00PM\n(except public holidays)\nMail: Customer Service Complaints\nPetinsurance.com.au\nLocked Bag 9021, Castle Hill, NSW 1765\nWebsite: www.petinsurance.com.au\nPetSure\nPrivacy enquiries\nPhone: (02) 9842 4800\nEmail: privacy@petsure.com.au\nMail: PetSure (Australia) Pty Ltd\nLocked Bag 9021, Castle Hill, NSW 1765\nWebsite: www.petsure.com.au\nHollard (for renewing policies first issued before 7 November 2023)\nPrivacy enquiries\nPhone: (02) 9253 6600\nEmail: privacy@hollard.com.au\nMail: The Hollard Insurance Company Pty Ltd\nLocked bag 2010, St Leonards, NSW 1590\nWebsite: www.hollard.com.au\n59\n60\n61\n\u2022 This Combined Financial Services Guide and\nProduct Disclosure Statement was prepared on\n\u2022 12 March 2024.\n\u2022\n\u2022 (02B)_pinscom2_12032024\n",

Total benefits\npaid to you across all insurance cannot exceed your actual\nexpenses.\nHow we prevent or handle fraud\nUnfortunately, fraud and attempted fraud can occur. We\nemploy sophisticated fraud detection and prevention\ntechniques to ensure we only pay genuine claims. By doing this\nwe\u2019re protecting you and all our policyholders.\nYou must not act in a fraudulent manner.

For example, if you:\n\u2022 do not comply with the policy terms and conditions;\n\u2022 do not pay your premium as agreed;\n\u2022 make a fraudulent claim; or\n\u2022 did not comply with your duty to take reasonable care not to\nmake a misrepresentation.\nIf we cancel your policy, we\u2019ll retain and/or refund any premium\nas the law allows us to do so.\n34\nChanging your cover\nYou can change the cover for your pet by choosing cover with\ndifferent or additional benefits, where eligible and available to\nyou.

If you change the\nMedibank Pet Insurance product you have for your pet, with a\ndifferent level of cover, waiting periods will only apply to any\nconditions or benefits covered by the new product that weren\u2019t\ncovered under your previous product.\n35\n8 Other\nimportant\ninformation\nThis section includes other important information on how we\ncommunicate with you, your duty to take reasonable care not to\nmake a misrepresentation, how we calculate your premium and\nmore.\nDelivery of your policy documents\nUnless you instruct us otherwise, we prefer to send your policy\ndocuments and communicate with you electronically.

It\u2019s also important to\nunderstand that, in answering the questions, you\u2019re answering\nfor yourself and anyone else to whom the questions apply.\nIf any of our questions aren\u2019t clear and you need help, please\ncontact us.\n36\nWhen this duty applies\nThe duty to take reasonable care not to make a\nmisrepresentation also applies before you renew, vary, extend\nor reinstate an existing contract of insurance. This means that\nyou must inform us of any changes to the information set out\nin your certificate of insurance, where the information is no\nlonger honest, accurate and complete. If you don\u2019t contact us\nto update this information, we\u2019ll take it that you agree that the\ninformation remains honest, accurate and complete. Please\ncontact us if you have any doubts.\nIf you don\u2019t comply with your duty\nIf you don\u2019t take reasonable care in answering our questions or\ninform us of changes to the information set out in your policy\ndocuments, you may breach your duty. If that happens, your\npolicy may be cancelled, or treated as if it never existed, and\nany claim may be denied or not paid in full.\nUpdates to the PDS\nWe may need to update this PDS from time to time when certain\nchanges occur and where we\u2019re required and permitted by law\nto do so. If that happens, we\u2019ll issue you with a new PDS or a\nSupplementary PDS or other compliant document to update the\nrelevant information.\nWhere the information isn\u2019t materially adverse from the point\nof view of a reasonable person considering whether to buy or\ncontinue to hold this insurance, we may issue you with notice in\na different form, including but not limited to disclosure updates\non the PetSure and/or Medibank website(s).\nYou can contact us to get a free paper copy or download an\nelectronic copy that summarises these changes.\n37\nHow we calculate your premium\nYour premium is calculated when your Medibank Pet Insurance\npolicy begins, at each policy anniversary, and also if you vary\nyour cover. The premium for each policy period is printed on\nyour certificate of insurance.\nThe amount you pay also includes allowances for government\nfees, taxes and charges, including stamp duty and GST.\nFor new policies\nWe calculate your premium based on several factors. Some\nare pre-set and don\u2019t vary, e.g. amounts we consider for some\ninternal expenses. Others can affect the premium amount\ndepending on whether we believe it increases or decreases the\nrisk to us. For example, the type of cover and options you have\nselected.\nWe\u2019ll also take into account risk factors associated with you\nand your pet such as your pet\u2019s breed and age. For instance, as\nyour pet gets older the risk of your pet requiring treatment will\nincrease and so the premium increases.\nThere are also commercial factors that affect your premium,\nincluding costs associated with operating our business and our\ncommercial arrangements.\nYour premium calculation may also include discounts or\npromotional offers that we provide. If you qualify for two or more\ndiscounts, we apply a specific order to our calculation of your\nfinal premium.\nAlso, any discounts and/or your premium may be rounded up or\ndown and some may only apply in the first year of coverage.\nFor renewals and changes to your policy\nFor renewals, we also factor in the claim history for your pet and\nthe average cost of care for pets like yours, as well as the claims\nexperience across all our insured pets. Because of all of these\nfactors and the changes to your pet\u2019s risk profile, your premium\nwill increase from year to year.\nWhen calculating your premium on renewal, we also consider\nhow much your premium was previously, including any discounts\nthat may have been applied. This means that we may limit\nmovements up or down.\nThese same factors and others are also used to calculate your\npremium if you amend your coverage.\nFor information about how and when to pay your premium,\nplease read the \u201cPaying your premium\u201d section.\n38\nCooling off period\nYou have a 21 day period to ensure you\u2019re happy with every\naspect of your policy.\nDuring this time, you can contact us and cancel your policy. If\nwe receive your request to cancel your policy within the 21 day\nperiod after the policy commencement date or renewal date\nand as long as you\u2019ve not made a claim or intend to make a\nclaim, we\u2019ll give you a refund of any monies received since that\ndate. We may also deduct any taxes or duties that we\u2019re unable\nto refund.\nIf you\u2019ve made a claim during the cooling off period and wish to\ncancel your policy, then any refund will be in accordance with\nprovisions set out in the \u201cCancellation by you\u201d section.\nAfter the cooling off period ends, you\u2019ll still be able to cancel\nyour policy and you have rights upon cancellation in certain\ncircumstances under the policy. See the \u201cCancellation by you\u201d\nsection for more information.\n39\nHow to make a complaint\nWe hope you\u2019ll never have reason to complain, but if you do,\nwe\u2019ll do our best to work with you to resolve it.\nOur complaints resolution process has three steps.

Words that are italicised in\nthis booklet have the special meaning explained in this section.\nBehavioural condition means behavioural conditions\ndiagnosed by a vet including but not limited to anxiety, phobias,\ncompulsive disorders and impulse control problems.\nNote: Behavioural conditions may be eligible for cover under\n\u201cExtra care\u201d if you have this.\nBenefit limit and Sub-limit(s) means as follows:\nBenefit limit means the applicable maximum amount payable\nby us in any one policy period, for your cover (but excluding\nextra care, if you have this. See the extra care definition).\nSub-limit(s) means the applicable maximum amount(s) payable\nby us in any one policy period, for particular items, treatments\nor conditions that you have cover for.\nThe amounts of your benefit limit and sub-limit(s), together with\nparticular items subject to sub-limit(s) are specified on your\ncertificate of insurance.\nAlso note:\n\u2022 We\u2019ll never pay more than the overall annual benefit limit,\nor sub-limit specified on your certificate of insurance. This\nmeans that if a sub-limit applies for a particular item of\ncover, condition or treatment, we won\u2019t pay more than that\namount, either on an individual or per claim basis for that\nitem. This is also subject to the overall benefit limit or other\nrelevant sub-limit not having been exceeded.\n\u2022 The benefit limit and sub-limits are reset when you\nrenew your policy. This means that policy benefits don\u2019t\naccumulate across policy periods. They expire at the end of\neach policy period.\n\u2022 The benefit limit and sub-limits (if any) are also subject to the\nexcess (if any) applicable to your cover.\n50\nBenefit percentage means the percentage of each claim for\neligible vet expenses, eligible emergency pet boarding costs,\nand eligible costs for other covered items which we reimburse,\nsubject to your benefit limit (where applicable), the extra care\nlimit (where applicable) and excess (if any). The applicable\nbenefit percentage will be shown on your certificate of\ninsurance.\nNote: The benefit percentage does not apply to routine care\nitems.\nBilateral condition means any condition affecting body parts on\neach side of your pet\u2019s body, e.g. ears, eyes, knees or elbows.\nA bilateral condition is considered a single condition when\napplying a benefit limit, sub-limit (if any), excess (if any) or\nexclusion.\nExample 1: if your pet had elbow dysplasia in the left elbow prior\nto the commencement date of the first policy period or during\nthe applicable waiting period, and this falls within the definition\nof a pre-existing condition, a subsequent elbow dysplasia in the\nright elbow will still be considered a pre-existing condition.\nExample 2: if your pet suffers from a patella luxation in its left\nhind leg and arthritis in its right hind leg, this is not a bilateral\ncondition. Patella luxation and arthritis aren\u2019t the same\ncondition.\nCertificate of insurance is the certificate we provide you that\noutlines the key details of the contract of insurance between\nyou and us. It includes the policy number, cover, excess (if any),\ncommencement date, end date, insured pet details, and the\nschedule of benefits, including your benefit percentage, benefit\nlimits and sub-limits (if any) and the extra care limit (where\napplicable).\nNote: A certificate of insurance is issued to you when we accept\nyour application for cover, on each renewal, and whenever your\npolicy is amended.\nChronic condition means a long-lasting condition which is\nrecurring or present in your pet over a period greater than three\nmonths in total, however the three-month period need not\nbe consecutive. Chronic conditions may also be intermittent\nor managed with medication and/or prescription diets with\nintervals of remission.\nExamples include (but aren\u2019t limited to): chronic or seasonal\nallergies, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis,\ncancer and some autoimmune diseases.\n51\nIf a chronic condition is a pre-existing condition, it will always\nbe excluded from cover. That means, it will never be considered\na temporary condition.\nCommencement date unless otherwise specified, is the date\nwhen cover for your pet started in the current policy period as\nshown on your certificate of insurance. The start time is 11:59PM\non that date.\nNote: Also see the first policy period definition for\ncommencement date of first policy period.\nCondition means any specified accidental injury, or any\nmanifestation of an illness. Where covered under extra care, this\nalso includes a specified dental condition and a behavioural\ncondition.\nConsultation and other derivations means an examination\nperformed by or under the supervision of a vet, including\na physical consultation, inpatient examination, in-hospital\nexamination, health certificate, consultation or recheck\nconsultation/visit, referral/specialist consultation/visits, phone\nconsultation, web consultation and emergency and after-hours\nconsultations/visits.\nNote: Any applicable sub-limit will be shown on your certificate\nof insurance.\nCover means:\n\u2022 Cover for specified accidental injury, illness and any other\noptional or included benefits (together with their limits)\napplicable to your selected policy.\nAND\n\u2022 The cover applicable under your policy for your selected\nplan and any previous policies you\u2019ve held with us where the\nsame or a substantially similar or a higher level of cover was\nprovided in the current policy period, without any break or\ntime without holding the cover.\nNote: Your certificate of insurance tells you which plan you\nhave.

No further\nbenefits or entitlements can be paid under the policy for vet\nexpenses or other claims expenses incurred after the end date.\nThe end time is 11:59PM on that date.\nUnless otherwise specified, this relates to the end date of your\ncurrent policy period.\nThe end date is shown on your certificate of insurance. If the\npolicy is cancelled, then the date of cancellation will be deemed\nto be the end date.\nExcess means an amount you contribute towards the cost of\nyour claim(s), as shown on your certificate of insurance. The\nexcess is calculated on a \u2018per condition, per policy period\u2019\nbasis. We do this for each condition treated that is unrelated to\nany other condition during the same policy period. Your excess\nalso applies to each emergency pet boarding claim event. The\nexcess will be deducted from your calculated claim benefits\nafter we apply any benefit limit, sub-limit (if any), extra care limit\n(where applicable) and the benefit percentage to your claimed\n\u201cAdditional and optional benefits\u201d section which provides\ncover for specified dental conditions and specialised therapies\nsubject to the extra care limit, excess (if any) and benefit\npercentage applicable to your policy.

This\nmeans that policy benefits for extra care don\u2019t accumulate\nacross policy periods. They expire at the end of each policy\nperiod.\n\u2022 The extra care limit is also subject to the excess (if any)\napplicable to your cover.\nFirst policy period means the time during which we first provided\ncover to you, so long as there has been no break or lapse in\ncover for your pet. In the event of a break or lapse in cover for\nyour pet, the first policy period means the time during which we\nfirst provided cover to you after the lapse or break in coverage.\nFor clarity, the commencement date of your first policy period is\n11:59PM on the date when cover for your pet first started.\nGST means the Australian Goods and Services Tax at the\nofficially published tax rate.\nHip joint surgery means surgery of the coxofemoral joint or\npelvis, and the associated soft tissue structures for treatment\nof a condition affecting the hip.

We\u2019ll then respond\nto you (and your vet if submitted on your behalf) in writing\nwith the outcome. A pre-approval isn\u2019t valid unless we\u2019ve\nagreed to it in writing.\nNote: If we agree to a pre-approval but the treatment\nprovided by your vet differs from the treatment request in\nthe pre-approval, then our assessment of the amount we\ncover under your claim may vary from the notified pre-\napproval amount. A variation in the amount we cover may\nalso occur if you have reached your benefit limit, sub-limit\nor other applicable limit on the claim.\nand calculates your pet insurance claim benefits while you\u2019re\nstill at the vet. If your vet is GapOnly\u00ae enabled, you don\u2019t\nneed to pay your vet in full prior to the submission of your\nclaim. Instead, your vet submits the claim to us electronically\non your behalf and you agree to pay the \u2018gap\u2019 (the difference\nbetween the vet\u2019s invoice and the claim benefit calculated, if\nany, under your policy).\nYou must pay the gap to your treating vet at the time you\nmake a GapOnly\u00ae claim.

We\u2019ll contact you or your\nvet if required;\n\u2022 there may be situations where we request additional\nveterinary history from current or previous vets, e.g. if\nthere\u2019s a large history gap, to ensure we have all relevant\nclinical information for your pet;\n\u2022 for adopted pets, veterinary history is only required from\nwhen you took ownership. You\u2019ll need to provide us with\nproof of adoption or transfer of ownership papers;\n\u2022 if you\u2019re making an emergency boarding claim, we may\nrequire supporting documentation;\n\u2022 unless we agree otherwise, all of your claims must\ninclude itemised tax invoice(s), payment receipt(s) and\nvet consultation notes if applicable;\n\u2022 incomplete claim forms may result in a processing\ndelay.

Total\nbenefits paid to you across all insurance cannot exceed your\nactual expenses.\nHow we prevent or handle fraud\nUnfortunately, fraud and attempted fraud can occur. We\nemploy sophisticated fraud detection and prevention\ntechniques to ensure we only pay genuine claims. By doing\nthis we\u2019re protecting you and all our policyholders.\nYou must not act in a fraudulent manner. If you or anyone\nacting for you:\n\u2022 makes a claim, submits a document, or makes a\nstatement in support of a claim under the policy\nknowing the claim, document or statement to be false or\nfraudulently exaggerated in any respect;\n\u2022 works with your vet to behave in a fraudulent manner\nregarding a claim, e.g. pressuring your vet to note\nincorrect information; or\n\u2022 makes a claim in respect of any loss or damage caused\nby your willful act or by colluding with another person;\nThen:\n\u2022 we may be entitled to refuse to pay all or part of the\nclaim, to the extent permitted by law;\n\u2022 we may cancel your policy and any other insurance\npolicies you hold with us;\n\u2022 we may be entitled to reclaim any payments already\nmade to you in respect of such claims;\n\u2022 we may not refund a premium already paid; or\n\u2022 we may inform the police of the circumstances and we\nmay take legal action.\n29\n6\nPAYING YOUR\nPREMIUM\nYour insurance policy cover is provided on the basis that\nyou\u2019ve paid or agreed to pay us the premium for that\ncover. The amount you pay is shown on your certificate of\ninsurance. It includes all premium, administration fees and\nany applicable discounts, government taxes, fees and/or\ncharges.\nWe like to think we don\u2019t miss a thing, but if you have a\nquestion about anything on your certificate of insurance,\nplease contact us.\nHow to pay\nYour pet insurance premium is payable when you take out a\nnew policy and subsequently when your policy is renewed.\nPremiums can be paid via direct debit through a credit card\nor bank account:\n\u2022 annually;\nOR\n\u2022 in monthly or fortnightly instalments.\nWhen premiums are paid in monthly or fortnightly\ninstalments, you\u2019ll be charged a collection fee per instalment,\nthe amount of which will be displayed on your certificate of\ninsurance.\nIf we accept and pay a claim under your policy, we may\ndeduct the balance of any outstanding premium from the\nclaim payment.\nPaying on time\nYou need to make sure your premium payment(s) are up to\ndate. If you have a policy that you\u2019re paying by instalments\nand we haven\u2019t received an instalment payment by its due\ndate, we\u2019ll send you a notice in writing by mail, email or text\nmessage about your non-payment.\nThis will be at least 14 calendar days before any cancellation\nof your policy for non-payment.\n30\nIf we don\u2019t receive the instalment payment after sending this\nnotice, we\u2019ll send you a second notice in writing, again by\nmail, email or text message.\nThis will happen either:\n\u2022 prior to cancellation of your policy, informing you\nthat your instalment policy is being cancelled for non-\npayment if the unpaid premium remains in arrears for\nmore than one month;\nOR\n\u2022 within 14 calendar days after cancellation by us,\nconfirming our cancellation of your instalment policy\nafter the unpaid premium was in arrears for at least one\nmonth.\nIf one or more instalments has remained unpaid for a period\nof at least 14 calendar days, then we reserve the right to\nreduce any claim made on the policy by the amount of any\noutstanding premium.\nCancellation consequences\nIf we cancel your policy due to non-payment of an\ninstalment premium, please be aware that:\n\u2022 no benefits or entitlements can be paid under the policy\nfor vet expenses or other claims expenses incurred after\nthe cancellation date;\n\u2022 you may be refused cover in the future under any policy\nadministered by PetSure; and\n\u2022 any application for general insurance products (with any\nprovider) in the future may be affected because you had\na policy cancelled because of unpaid premiums.\nYour payment account\nWhen you provide us with your nominated credit card or\nbank account details, we use these to directly debit the\npremium calculated by us from that card or account.\nUnless you opt out of automatic renewals or tell us that you\ndon\u2019t want to renew your policy, we\u2019ll deduct/charge the\nrenewal premium from your nominated credit card or bank\naccount.\nIf your premium can\u2019t be paid, e.g. there isn\u2019t enough money\nin your nominated account, you may be charged a fee by\nyour bank. It\u2019s important that you know that neither Hollard\nnor PetSure will be responsible for fees charged by your\nbank or financial institution.\n31\nIf your direct debit fails, we\u2019ll notify you of this and\nautomatically retry for the outstanding amount within\n14 calendar days. Should this second attempt fail, we\u2019ll\ntry again after 14 calendar days and, depending on your\npayment frequency, we\u2019ll deduct either the outstanding\namount, or the outstanding amount together with your\nregular instalment.\nIf you\u2019d like to make a real-time payment of your\noutstanding balance before we reattempt a direct debit, just\ncall us to do this.\nFor payments by direct debit\nFor Hollard issued policies, if the direct debit bank account is\nnot yours, you confirm you have the authority of the account\nholder to use it and that they\u2019ve agreed to these terms.\nFor PetSure issued policies, you must have the sole authority\nas the account holder of the direct debit bank account and\nagree to the Direct Debit Request Service Agreement.\nFor payments by credit card\nIf the credit card is not yours, you confirm you have the\nauthority of the credit card account holder to use it and that\nthey\u2019ve agreed to these terms.\nShould you have questions about the operation of the direct\ndebit authority or you need to change any aspects of the\nauthority, please contact us.\n32\n7\nRENEWALS,\nCANCELLATIONS\n& CHANGES\nThis part of the booklet explains your options for renewing,\ncancelling or changing the cover for your pet insurance\npolicy.\nAnnual renewal of your insurance policy\nAs long as we continue to provide the product, we\u2019ll offer\nrenewal of your policy every year.

Where\nyou have opted-out of automatic renewal, you\u2019ll need to\ncontact us after you\u2019ve received your offer of renewal if\nyou\u2019d like to renew your policy.\nThe notice will also remind you:\n\u2022 that you can opt out of the automatic renewal process at\nany time in the future;\n\u2022 to check the information we have on your certificate of\ninsurance is correct; and\n\u2022 to review your insurance cover to consider if the policy\nlimits and level of cover are still right for you.\n33\nUnless you opt out of automatic renewals or tell us that you\ndon\u2019t want to renew your policy, we\u2019ll deduct/charge the\nrenewal premium from your nominated account or credit\ncard. See the \u201cYour payment account\u201d section for more\ninformation.\nYour premium\nEvery year, we\u2019ll notify you of the changes to your annual\npremium. We review the cost of everyone\u2019s insurance, taking\naccount of a range of factors. These are set out under the\n\u201cHow we calculate your premium\u201d section.\nCancellation by you\nYou can cancel your policy with us at any time by contacting\nour customer service team.

We\u2019ll refund you the residual premium for the\nunexpired period (less any government or statutory charges\nthat apply). We call this providing you a pro-rata refund,\nbased on the number of days we insured you.\nPaying by instalment?\nIf you\u2019ve been paying your premiums by instalment, there\u2019s\nno premium refund for any remaining days of a current\ninstalment period. No further premium instalments will be\ndeducted.\nIf your pet passes away\nWe know there is a lot going on when your pet passes away,\nbut we\u2019re here to help. Please contact us as soon as possible\nand we\u2019ll cancel your policy from the date of your pet\npassing. We\u2019ll adjust the premium, as outlined above.\nYour cancellation rights during the cooling off period\nYour cooling off cancellation rights apply when you buy\nyour policy and also exist when your policy renews or is\nreissued following a change in your cover. You can find more\ninformation in the \u201cCooling off period\u201d section.\n34\nCancellation by us\nWe may cancel your policy where permitted by and in\naccordance with the law.

For\nexample, if you:\n\u2022 do not comply with the policy terms and conditions;\n\u2022 do not pay your premium as agreed;\n\u2022 make a fraudulent claim; or\n\u2022 did not comply with your duty to take reasonable care\nnot to make a misrepresentation.\nIf we cancel your policy, we\u2019ll retain and/or refund any\npremium as the law allows us to do so.\nChanging your cover\nYou can change the cover for your pet by choosing cover\nwith different or additional benefits, where eligible and\navailable to you. You may, for example, want a different\nbenefit percentage or benefit limit, or to upgrade your\ncoverage.\nIf you haven\u2019t had a claim paid and want to change your\ncover, just contact us and we\u2019ll issue you a new policy\nnumber and certificate of insurance outlining your new\npremium and your previous policy number will be cancelled.\nHowever, you can\u2019t change your cover if a claim has been\npaid during your current policy period. You\u2019ll need to wait\nuntil your next policy renewal.\nWaiting periods already completed won\u2019t be reapplied\nunless there has been a break or lapse in your cover. If you\nchange the Petinsurance.com.au product you have for your\npet, with a different level of cover, waiting periods will only\napply to any conditions covered by the new product that\nweren\u2019t covered under your previous product.\n35\n8\nOTHER\nIMPORTANT\nINFORMATION\nThis section includes other important information on how\nwe communicate with you, your duty to take reasonable\ncare not to make a misrepresentation, how we calculate your\npremium and more.\nDelivery of your policy documents\nUnless you instruct us otherwise, we prefer to send your\npolicy documents and communicate with you electronically.\nWhere you\u2019ve agreed to receive electronic communications,\nyou\u2019ll need to provide us with your email address and mobile\nnumber.\nWhen we send your policy documents by email, we\u2019ll\nconsider that you have received them on the date recorded\non our information system.\nYou can instruct us to provide these documents by post, to a\nmailing address you provide, either when you purchase your\npolicy or at any time by contacting us.\nYou\u2019re responsible for making sure the email and postal\naddresses you\u2019ve given us are correct and up-to-date at all\ntimes.\nYour duty to take reasonable care not to make a\nmisrepresentation\nBefore you enter into this contract of insurance with us,\nyou have a duty to take reasonable care not to make a\nmisrepresentation under the Insurance Contracts Act 1984\n(Cth).\nThis means you need to take reasonable care to provide\nhonest, accurate and complete answers to any questions\nthat we ask. It is very important that you do so, as we base\nour decision whether to provide cover and the terms on\nwhich we do so on your answers.\n36\nIf you\u2019re not sure of the answers to any of our questions,\nyou should take the time to find them. It\u2019s also important\nto understand that, in answering the questions, you\u2019re\nanswering for yourself and anyone else to whom the\nquestions apply.\nIf any of our questions aren\u2019t clear and you need help, please\ncontact us.\nWhen this duty applies\nThe duty to take reasonable care not to make a\nmisrepresentation also applies before you renew, vary,\nextend or reinstate an existing contract of insurance. This\nmeans that you must inform us of any changes to the\ninformation set out in your certificate of insurance, where the\ninformation is no longer honest, accurate and complete. If\nyou don\u2019t contact us to update this information, we\u2019ll take it\nthat you agree that the information remains honest, accurate\nand complete. Please contact us if you have any doubts.\nIf you don\u2019t comply with your duty\nIf you don\u2019t take reasonable care in answering our questions\nor inform us of changes to the information set out in\nyour policy documents, you may breach your duty. If that\nhappens, your policy may be cancelled, or treated as if it\nnever existed, and any claim may be denied or not paid in\nfull.\nUpdates to the PDS\nWe may need to update this PDS from time to time when\ncertain changes occur and where we\u2019re required and\npermitted by law to do so. If that happens, we\u2019ll issue you\nwith a new PDS or a Supplementary PDS or other compliant\ndocument to update the relevant information.\nWhere the information isn\u2019t materially adverse from the\npoint of view of a reasonable person considering whether\nto buy or continue to hold this insurance, we may issue you\nwith notice in a different form, including but not limited to\ndisclosure updates on the PetSure and/or\nPetinsurance.com.au website(s).\nYou can contact us to get a free paper copy or download an\nelectronic copy that summarises these changes.\n37\nHow we calculate your premium\nYour premium is calculated when your Petinsurance.com.au\npolicy begins, at each policy anniversary, and also if you vary\nyour cover. The premium for each policy period is printed on\nyour certificate of insurance.\nThe amount you pay also includes allowances for\ngovernment fees, taxes and charges, including stamp duty\nand GST.\nFor new policies\nWe calculate your premium based on several factors. Some\nare pre-set and don\u2019t vary, e.g. amounts we consider for\nsome internal expenses. Others can affect the premium\namount depending on whether we believe it increases or\ndecreases the risk to us. For example, the type of cover and\noptions you have selected.\nWe\u2019ll also take into account risk factors associated with\nyou and your pet such as your pet\u2019s breed and age. For\ninstance, as your pet gets older the risk of your pet requiring\ntreatment will increase and so the premium increases.\nThere are also commercial factors that affect your premium,\nincluding costs associated with operating our business and\nour commercial arrangements.\nYour premium calculation may also include discounts or\npromotional offers that we provide. If you qualify for two or\nmore discounts, we apply a specific order to our calculation\nof your final premium.\nAlso, any discounts and/or your premium may be rounded\nup or down and some may only apply in the first year of\ncoverage.\nFor renewals and changes to your policy\nFor renewals, we also factor in the claim history for your pet\nand the average cost of care for pets like yours, as well as\nthe claims experience across all our insured pets. Because of\nall of these factors and the changes to your pet\u2019s risk profile,\nyour premium will increase from year to year.\nWhen calculating your premium on renewal, we also\nconsider how much your premium was previously, including\nany discounts that may have been applied. This means that\nwe may limit movements up or down.\n38\nThese same factors and others are also used to calculate\nyour premium if you amend your coverage.\nFor information about how and when to pay your premium,\nplease read the \u201cPaying your premium\u201d section.\nCooling off period\nYou have a 30 day period to ensure you\u2019re happy with every\naspect of your policy.\nDuring this time, you can contact us and cancel your policy.\nIf we receive your request to cancel your policy within the\n30 day period after the policy commencement date or\nrenewal date and as long as you\u2019ve not made a claim or\nintend to make a claim, we\u2019ll give you a refund of any monies\nreceived since that date. We may also deduct any taxes or\nduties that we\u2019re unable to refund.\nIf you\u2019ve made a claim during the cooling off period and\nwish to cancel your policy, then any refund will be in\naccordance with provisions set out in the \u201cCancellation by\nyou\u201d section.\nAfter the cooling off period ends, you\u2019ll still be able to cancel\nyour policy and you have rights upon cancellation in certain\ncircumstances under the policy.

Words that are italicised\nin this booklet have the special meaning explained in this\nsection.\nBenefit limit and Sub-limit(s) means as follows:\nBenefit limit means the applicable maximum amount\npayable by us in any one policy period, for your cover.\nSub-limit(s) means the applicable maximum amount(s)\npayable by us in any one policy period, for particular items,\ntreatments or conditions that you have cover for.\nThe amounts of your benefit limit and sub-limit(s), together\nwith particular items subject to sub-limit(s) are specified on\nyour certificate of insurance.\nAlso note:\n\u2022 we\u2019ll never pay more than the overall annual benefit limit\nor sub-limit specified on your certificate of insurance.\nThis means that if a sub-limit applies for a particular item\nof cover, condition or treatment, we won\u2019t pay more than\nthat amount, either on an individual or per claim basis for\nthat item. This is also subject to the overall benefit limit\nor other relevant sub-limit not having been exceeded.\n\u2022 the benefit limit and sub-limits are reset when you\nrenew your policy. This means that policy benefits don\u2019t\naccumulate across policy periods. They expire at the end\nof each policy period.\n\u2022 the benefit limit and sub-limits are also subject to the\nexcess (if any) applicable to your cover.\nBenefit percentage means the stated percentage of each\nclaim for eligible vet expenses and eligible costs for covered\nitems which we reimburse, subject to the applicable benefit\nlimit or sub-limit and excesses. The applicable benefit\npercentage will be shown on your certificate of insurance.\nNote: The benefit percentage does not apply to routine care\nitems.\n50\nBilateral condition means any condition affecting body parts\non each side of your pet\u2019s body, e.g. ears, eyes, knees or\nelbows.\nA bilateral condition is considered a single condition\nwhen applying a benefit limit, sub-limit, excess (if any) or\nexclusion.\nExample 1: if your pet had elbow dysplasia in the left elbow\nprior to the commencement date of the first policy period or\nduring the applicable waiting period, and this falls within the\ndefinition of a pre-existing condition, a subsequent elbow\ndysplasia in the right elbow will still be considered a pre-\nexisting condition.\nExample 2: if your pet suffers from a patella luxation in its\nleft hind leg and arthritis in its right hind leg, this is not a\nbilateral condition. Patella luxation and arthritis aren\u2019t the\nsame condition.\nCertificate of insurance is the certificate we provide you that\noutlines the key details of the contract of insurance between\nyou and us. It includes the policy number, cover, excess (if\nany), commencement date, end date, insured pet details, and\nthe schedule of benefits, including benefit limits, sub-limits\nand dental illness limit (if applicable).\nNote: A certificate of insurance is issued to you when we\naccept your application for cover, on each renewal, and\nwhenever your policy is amended.\nChronic condition means a long-lasting condition which\nis recurring or present in your pet over a period greater\nthan three months in total, however the three-month\nperiod need not be consecutive. Chronic conditions may\nalso be intermittent or managed with medication and/or\nprescription diets with intervals of remission.\nExamples include (but aren\u2019t limited to): chronic or\nseasonal allergies, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes,\nosteoarthritis, cancer and some autoimmune diseases.\nIf a chronic condition is a pre-existing condition, it will\nalways be excluded from cover. That means, it will never be\nconsidered a temporary condition.\n51\nCommencement date unless otherwise specified, is the date\nwhen cover for your pet started in the current policy period\nas shown on your certificate of insurance. The start time is\n11:59PM on that date.\nNote: Also see the first policy period definition for\ncommencement date of first policy period.\nCondition means any specified accidental injury, or any\nmanifestation of an illness. This also includes a specified\ndental condition, where covered under the dental illness\nbenefit.\nConsultation and other derivations means an examination\nperformed by or under the supervision of a vet, including\na physical consultation, inpatient examination, in-hospital\nexamination, health certificate, consultation or recheck\nconsultation/visit, referral/specialist consultation/visits,\nphone consultation, web consultation and emergency and\nafter-hours consultations/visits.\nNote: Any applicable sub-limit will be shown on your\ncertificate of insurance.\nCover means:\n\u2022 the benefit limit, sub-limits, excess (if any), benefit\npercentage and any other optional or additional benefits\n(including their limits) applicable to your selected policy;\nand\n\u2022 the cover applicable under your policy for your selected\nplan and any previous policies you\u2019ve held with us where\nthe same or a substantially similar or a higher level of\ncover was provided in the current policy period, without\nany break or time without holding the cover.\nNote: Your certificate of insurance tells you which plan\nyou have. The cover for your plan comprises of specified\naccidental injury cover, illness cover, additional benefits and\nany selected optional benefits.\nCruciate ligament condition means partial or complete\nrupture of the cruciate ligament(s). This includes meniscal\ntears, any looseness of the cruciate ligaments, along with\nany complications following treatment for this condition.\nDental illness benefit means the dental illness benefit\ndescribed in the \u201cAdditional and optional benefits\u201d section\nwhich provides benefits, up to the dental illness limit, for\neligible vet expenses incurred in relation to specified dental\nconditions.\n52\nDental illness limit means the dental illness limit amount\nspecified on your certificate of insurance, for the dental\nillness benefit, which is applied as follows:\n\u2022 for the Platinum plan, the dental illness limit is a sub-\nlimit subject to your benefit limit. This means that it is\nincluded as part of your overall benefit limit.\n\u2022 for the Gold plan, the dental illness limit is additional to\nyour policy\u2019s benefit limit.\nIf you have the dental illness benefit, also note:\n\u2022 we\u2019ll never pay more than the dental illness limit\nspecified on your certificate of insurance.\n\u2022 the dental illness limit resets if you renew your policy.\nThis means that policy benefits for the dental illness\nbenefit don\u2019t accumulate across policy periods. They\nexpire at the end of each policy period.\n\u2022 the dental illness limit is also subject to the excess (if\nany) applicable to your cover.\nElective treatment means a treatment or surgery that is\nbeneficial to your pet but is not essential for your pet\u2019s\nsurvival and doesn\u2019t form part of the treatment for a covered\ncondition.\nEnd date is the date when your policy terminates. No further\nbenefits or entitlements can be paid under the policy for vet\nexpenses or other claims expenses incurred after the end\ndate. The end time is 11:59PM on that date.\nUnless otherwise specified, this relates to the end date of\nyour current policy period.\nThe end date is shown on your certificate of insurance. If\nthe policy is cancelled, then the date of cancellation will be\ndeemed to be the end date.\nExcess means an amount you contribute towards the cost of\nyour claim(s), as shown on your certificate of insurance. The\nexcess is calculated on a \u2018per condition, per policy period\u2019\nbasis. We do this for each condition treated that is unrelated\nto any other condition during the same policy period. Your\nexcess also applies to each emergency boarding claim event.\nThe excess will be deducted from your calculated claim\nbenefits after we apply any benefit limit, sub-limit and the\nbenefit percentage to your claimed amount.\nPet means the dog or cat covered under the policy and\nnamed on your certificate of insurance.\nPolicy period means the time during which we provide cover\nas specified on your certificate of insurance.\nNote: Unless otherwise specified, this relates to your current\npolicy period.\nPre-existing condition means a condition that first existed or\noccurred:\n\u2022 prior to the commencement date of the first policy\nperiod; or\n\u2022 within any applicable waiting period; AND\n\u2022 of which you were aware of, or a reasonable person in\nyour circumstances would have been aware, irrespective\nof whether the underlying or causative condition has\nbeen diagnosed.\nA pre-existing condition also includes a related condition or\nbilateral condition of a pre-existing condition.\nRelated condition means a condition that results from the\nsame disease process, arises as a consequence of or has\nthe same diagnostic classification as another condition,\nregardless of the number of areas of your pet\u2019s body that\nare affected.\n54\nExamples\n\u2022 if your pet suffers from arthritis in its legs, all future\noccurrences of arthritis, e.g. in the back or neck, will be\nrelated conditions.\n\u2022 if your pet suffers from diabetes and then develops a\ncataract as a consequence of the diabetes, the cataract\nwill then be a related condition.\n\u2022 if your pet suffers from a skin hotspot, then later\nsuffers from ringworm on its skin, these aren\u2019t related\nconditions, as the ringworm is not as a consequence of\nthe hotspot, nor do they follow the same disease process\nor diagnostic classification.\nRoutine care means certain pet care items for your pet listed\non your certificate of insurance which are non-insurance\nbenefits. If you have these benefits, the list of allowable\nitems and the maximum amount payable during the policy\nperiod, are shown on your certificate of insurance.\nSpecified accidental injury means physical harm or injury\narising from at least one of the following:\n\u2022 a motor vehicle incident;\n\u2022 a burn or electrocution;\n\u2022 a reaction to a bite from an insect, spider or scorpion;\n\u2022 a near drowning incident;\nOR\nthe specified accidental injury must be one of the following:\n\u2022 a bone fracture;\n\u2022 a traumatic tooth fracture;\n\u2022 snake bite toxicity;\n\u2022 poisoning;\n\u2022 ingestion of a foreign object;\n\u2022 a traumatic ligament or tendon injury;\n\u2022 a bite wound or fight wound abscesses;\n\u2022 lacerations or abrasion of tissue, skin or mucous\nmembrane due to external trauma; or\n\u2022 a cruciate ligament condition.\nNote: We define an accident as a single unexpected event\nthat is unintended by you and is independent of any illness\nor specified dental condition.

We\u2019ll then respond\nto you (and your vet if submitted on your behalf) in writing\nwith the outcome. A pre-approval isn\u2019t valid unless we\u2019ve\nagreed to it in writing.\nNote: If we agree to a pre-approval but the treatment\nprovided by your vet differs from the treatment request in\nthe pre-approval, then our assessment of the amount we\ncover under your claim may vary from the notified pre-\napproval amount.

If your vet is GapOnly\u00ae enabled, you don\u2019t\nneed to pay your vet in full prior to the submission of your\nclaim. Instead, your vet submits the claim to us electronically\non your behalf and you agree to pay the \u2018gap\u2019 (the difference\nbetween the vet\u2019s invoice and the claim benefit calculated, if\nany, under your policy).\nYou must pay the gap to your treating vet at the time you\nmake a GapOnly\u00ae claim. We\u2019ll then pay the claim benefit (if\nany) directly to your vet.\nYou can find more information on GapOnly\u00ae here: www.\ngaponly.com.au.\nGapOnly\u00ae claim, we\u2019ll pay the claim benefits to you, not your\nvet.\n24\nYou agree that we\u2019re authorised to discuss with your vet, the\ndetails relating to your claim or the treatment provided to\nyour pet in relation to a claim made under your policy.

We\u2019ll contact you or your\nvet if required;\n\u2022 there may be situations where we request additional\nveterinary history from current or previous vets, e.g. if\nthere\u2019s a large history gap, to ensure we have all relevant\nclinical information for your pet;\n\u2022 for adopted pets, veterinary history is only required from\nwhen you took ownership. You\u2019ll need to provide us with\nproof of adoption or transfer of ownership papers;\n\u2022 if you\u2019re making an emergency boarding claim, we may\nrequire supporting documentation;\n\u2022 unless we agree otherwise, all of your claims must\ninclude itemised tax invoice(s), payment receipt(s) and\nvet consultation notes if applicable;\n\u2022 incomplete claim forms may result in a processing\ndelay.

For Hollard issued policies, all approved benefits\nwill be paid into your nominated bank account or by cheque.\nFor PetSure issued policies, we\u2019ll pay all approved benefits\ninto your nominated bank account.\nWe reserve the right to deduct from the benefit amount any\namount due to us, for example for any overdue premium\npayments.\nNote: In the event that we pay a benefit contrary to the\npolicy terms and conditions for whatever reason, this won\u2019t\nconstitute a waiver of our rights to apply the policy terms\nand conditions retrospectively to any paid claims or to any\nfuture claims for that or any related condition.\nWe also reserve our right to recover from you any benefit\namount received by you as a result of such error.\nDeclining to process your claim\nIf you or your vet refuse to or are unable to provide\ninformation reasonably requested by us to process your\nclaim, we may decline or reduce the amount payable for\nyour claim, in accordance with relevant law.\nFraudulent claims\nIf you submit a fraudulent claim or entice your vet to behave\nin a fraudulent manner regarding a claim, then the claim may\nbe denied or reduced in accordance with relevant law, and\nwe may cancel your policy altogether in the event you make\na fraudulent claim.

Total\nbenefits paid to you across all insurance cannot exceed your\nactual expenses.\nHow we prevent or handle fraud\nUnfortunately, fraud and attempted fraud can occur. We\nemploy sophisticated fraud detection and prevention\ntechniques to ensure we only pay genuine claims. By doing\nthis we\u2019re protecting you and all our policyholders.\nYou must not act in a fraudulent manner. If you or anyone\nacting for you:\n\u2022 makes a claim, submits a document, or makes a\nstatement in support of a claim under the policy\nknowing the claim, document or statement to be false or\nfraudulently exaggerated in any respect;\n\u2022 works with your vet to behave in a fraudulent manner\nregarding a claim, e.g. pressuring your vet to note\nincorrect information; or\n\u2022 makes a claim in respect of any loss or damage caused\nby your willful act or by colluding with another person;\nThen:\n\u2022 we may be entitled to refuse to pay all or part of the\nclaim, to the extent permitted by law;\n\u2022 we may cancel your policy and any other insurance\npolicies you hold with us;\n\u2022 we may be entitled to reclaim any payments already\nmade to you in respect of such claims;\n\u2022 we may not refund a premium already paid; or\n\u2022 we may inform the police of the circumstances and we\nmay take legal action.\n28\n6\nPAYING YOUR\nPREMIUM\nYour insurance policy cover is provided on the basis that\nyou\u2019ve paid or agreed to pay us the premium for that\ncover. The amount you pay is shown on your certificate of\ninsurance. It includes all premium, administration fees and\nany applicable discounts, government taxes, fees and/or\ncharges.\nWe like to think we don\u2019t miss a thing, but if you have a\nquestion about anything on your certificate of insurance,\nplease contact us.\nHow to pay\nYour pet insurance premium is payable when you take out a\nnew policy and subsequently when your policy is renewed.\nPremiums can be paid via direct debit through a credit card\nor bank account:\n\u2022 annually;\nOR\n\u2022 in monthly or fortnightly instalments.\nWhen premiums are paid in monthly or fortnightly\ninstalments, you\u2019ll be charged a collection fee per instalment,\nthe amount of which will be displayed on your certificate of\ninsurance.\nIf we accept and pay a claim under your policy, we may\ndeduct the balance of any outstanding premium from the\nclaim payment.\nPaying on time\nYou need to make sure your premium payment(s) are up to\ndate.

It\u2019s important that you know that neither Hollard\nnor PetSure will be responsible for fees charged by your\nbank or financial institution.\n30\nIf your direct debit fails, we\u2019ll notify you of this and\nautomatically retry for the outstanding amount within\n14 calendar days. Should this second attempt fail, we\u2019ll\ntry again after 14 calendar days and, depending on your\npayment frequency, we\u2019ll deduct either the outstanding\namount, or the outstanding amount together with your\nregular instalment.\nIf you\u2019d like to make a real-time payment of your\noutstanding balance before we reattempt a direct debit, just\ncall us to do this.\nFor payments by direct debit\nFor Hollard issued policies, if the direct debit bank account is\nnot yours, you confirm you have the authority of the account\nholder to use it and that they\u2019ve agreed to these terms.\nFor PetSure issued policies, you must have the sole authority\nas the account holder of the direct debit bank account and\nagree to the Direct Debit Request Service Agreement.\nFor payments by credit card\nIf the credit card is not yours, you confirm you have the\nauthority of the credit card account holder to use it and that\nthey\u2019ve agreed to these terms.\nShould you have questions about the operation of the direct\ndebit authority or you need to change any aspects of the\nauthority, please contact us.\n31\n7\nRENEWALS,\nCANCELLATIONS\n& CHANGES\nThis part of the booklet explains your options for renewing,\ncancelling or changing the cover for your pet insurance\npolicy.\nAnnual renewal of your insurance policy\nAs long as we continue to provide the product, we\u2019ll offer\nrenewal of your policy every year. This will be subject to the\napplicable terms and conditions of the policy for each policy\nperiod. We\u2019ll change the premium and may change the terms\nand conditions of the policy at the time of renewal, based on\na combination of factors, including the risk associated with\ninsuring pets like yours.\nRenewal procedure\nWhere we offer renewal of your policy, at least 14 days\nbefore your current policy expires, we\u2019ll send you an offer\nof renewal confirming the expiry date of your policy, and\nthe premium and terms on which we\u2019ll offer to renew your\ninsurance for the next policy period.\nUnless you\u2019ve chosen not to automatically renew your policy,\nyour policy will automatically renew on those terms. Where\nyou have opted-out of automatic renewal, you\u2019ll need to\ncontact us after you\u2019ve received your offer of renewal if\nyou\u2019d like to renew your policy.\nThe notice will also remind you:\n\u2022 that you can opt out of the automatic renewal process at\nany time in the future;\n\u2022 to check the information we have on your certificate of\ninsurance is correct; and\n\u2022 to review your insurance cover to consider if the policy\nlimits and level of cover are still right for you.\n32\nUnless you opt out of automatic renewals or tell us that you\ndon\u2019t want to renew your policy, we\u2019ll deduct/charge the\nrenewal premium from your nominated account or credit\ncard. See the \u201cYour payment account\u201d section for more\ninformation.\nYour premium\nEvery year, we\u2019ll notify you of the changes to your annual\npremium. We review the cost of everyone\u2019s insurance, taking\naccount of a range of factors. These are set out under the\n\u201cHow we calculate your premium\u201d section.\nCancellation by you\nYou can cancel your policy with us at any time by contacting\nour customer service team. Our \u201cContact details\u201d are on the\nlast page of this booklet.\nThe cancellation will be effective once we provide you with\na written confirmation of your request, either by email or\nletter.\nPaying annually?\nIf you\u2019ve been paying your premiums annually, we\u2019ll retain a\nportion of the premium that relates to the period that you\u2019ve\nbeen insured. We\u2019ll refund you the residual premium for the\nunexpired period (less any government or statutory charges\nthat apply). We call this providing you a pro-rata refund,\nbased on the number of days we insured you.\nPaying by instalment?\nIf you\u2019ve been paying your premiums by instalment, there\u2019s\nno premium refund for any remaining days of a current\ninstalment period. No further premium instalments will be\ndeducted.\nIf your pet passes away\nWe know there is a lot going on when your pet passes away,\nbut we\u2019re here to help. Please contact us as soon as possible\nand we\u2019ll cancel your policy from the date of your pet\npassing.

You can find more\ninformation in the \u201cCooling off period\u201d section.\n33\nCancellation by us\nWe may cancel your policy where permitted by and in\naccordance with the law.

For\nexample, if you:\n\u2022 do not comply with the policy terms and conditions;\n\u2022 do not pay your premium as agreed;\n\u2022 make a fraudulent claim; or\n\u2022 did not comply with your duty to take reasonable care\nnot to make a misrepresentation.\nIf we cancel your policy, we\u2019ll retain and/or refund any\npremium as the law allows us to do so.\nChanging your cover\nYou can change the cover for your pet by choosing cover\nwith different or additional benefits, where eligible and\navailable to you. You may, for example, want a different\nbenefit percentage or benefit limit, or to upgrade your\ncoverage.\nIf you haven\u2019t had a claim paid and want to change your\ncover, just contact us and we\u2019ll issue you a new policy\nnumber and certificate of insurance outlining your new\npremium and your previous policy number will be cancelled.\nHowever, you can\u2019t change your cover if a claim has been\npaid during your current policy period. You\u2019ll need to wait\nuntil your next policy renewal.\nWaiting periods already completed won\u2019t be reapplied\nunless there has been a break or lapse in your cover. If you\nchange the Petinsurance.com.au product you have for your\npet, with a different level of cover, waiting periods will only\napply to any conditions covered by the new product that\nweren\u2019t covered under your previous product.\n34\n8\nOTHER\nIMPORTANT\nINFORMATION\nThis section includes other important information on how\nwe communicate with you, your duty to take reasonable\ncare not to make a misrepresentation, how we calculate your\npremium and more.\nDelivery of your policy documents\nUnless you instruct us otherwise, we prefer to send your\npolicy documents and communicate with you electronically.\nWhere you\u2019ve agreed to receive electronic communications,\nyou\u2019ll need to provide us with your email address and mobile\nnumber.\nWhen we send your policy documents by email, we\u2019ll\nconsider that you have received them on the date recorded\non our information system.\nYou can instruct us to provide these documents by post, to a\nmailing address you provide, either when you purchase your\npolicy or at any time by contacting us.\nYou\u2019re responsible for making sure the email and postal\naddresses you\u2019ve given us are correct and up-to-date at all\ntimes.\nYour duty to take reasonable care not to make a\nmisrepresentation\nBefore you enter into this contract of insurance with us,\nyou have a duty to take reasonable care not to make a\nmisrepresentation under the Insurance Contracts Act 1984\n(Cth).\nThis means you need to take reasonable care to provide\nhonest, accurate and complete answers to any questions\nthat we ask. It is very important that you do so, as we base\nour decision whether to provide cover and the terms on\nwhich we do so on your answers.\n35\nIf you\u2019re not sure of the answers to any of our questions,\nyou should take the time to find them. It\u2019s also important\nto understand that, in answering the questions, you\u2019re\nanswering for yourself and anyone else to whom the\nquestions apply.\nIf any of our questions aren\u2019t clear and you need help, please\ncontact us.\nWhen this duty applies\nThe duty to take reasonable care not to make a\nmisrepresentation also applies before you renew, vary,\nextend or reinstate an existing contract of insurance. This\nmeans that you must inform us of any changes to the\ninformation set out in your certificate of insurance, where the\ninformation is no longer honest, accurate and complete. If\nyou don\u2019t contact us to update this information, we\u2019ll take it\nthat you agree that the information remains honest, accurate\nand complete. Please contact us if you have any doubts.\nIf you don\u2019t comply with your duty\nIf you don\u2019t take reasonable care in answering our questions\nor inform us of changes to the information set out in\nyour policy documents, you may breach your duty. If that\nhappens, your policy may be cancelled, or treated as if it\nnever existed, and any claim may be denied or not paid in\nfull.\nUpdates to the PDS\nWe may need to update this PDS from time to time when\ncertain changes occur and where we\u2019re required and\npermitted by law to do so. If that happens, we\u2019ll issue you\nwith a new PDS or a Supplementary PDS or other compliant\ndocument to update the relevant information.\nWhere the information isn\u2019t materially adverse from the\npoint of view of a reasonable person considering whether\nto buy or continue to hold this insurance, we may issue you\nwith notice in a different form, including but not limited to\ndisclosure updates on the PetSure and/or\nPetinsurance.com.au website(s).\nYou can contact us to get a free paper copy or download an\nelectronic copy that summarises these changes.\n36\nHow we calculate your premium\nYour premium is calculated when your Petinsurance.com.au\npolicy begins, at each policy anniversary, and also if you vary\nyour cover. The premium for each policy period is printed on\nyour certificate of insurance.\nThe amount you pay also includes allowances for\ngovernment fees, taxes and charges, including stamp duty\nand GST.\nFor new policies\nWe calculate your premium based on several factors. Some\nare pre-set and don\u2019t vary, e.g. amounts we consider for\nsome internal expenses. Others can affect the premium\namount depending on whether we believe it increases or\ndecreases the risk to us. For example, the type of cover and\noptions you have selected.\nWe\u2019ll also take into account risk factors associated with\nyou and your pet such as your pet\u2019s breed and age. For\ninstance, as your pet gets older the risk of your pet requiring\ntreatment will increase and so the premium increases.\nThere are also commercial factors that affect your premium,\nincluding costs associated with operating our business and\nour commercial arrangements.\nYour premium calculation may also include discounts or\npromotional offers that we provide. If you qualify for two or\nmore discounts, we apply a specific order to our calculation\nof your final premium.\nAlso, any discounts and/or your premium may be rounded\nup or down and some may only apply in the first year of\ncoverage.\nFor renewals and changes to your policy\nFor renewals, we also factor in the claim history for your pet\nand the average cost of care for pets like yours, as well as\nthe claims experience across all our insured pets. Because of\nall of these factors and the changes to your pet\u2019s risk profile,\nyour premium will increase from year to year.\nWhen calculating your premium on renewal, we also\nconsider how much your premium was previously, including\nany discounts that may have been applied. This means that\nwe may limit movements up or down.\n37\nThese same factors and others are also used to calculate\nyour premium if you amend your coverage.\nFor information about how and when to pay your premium,\nplease read the \u201cPaying your premium\u201d section.\nCooling off period\nYou have a 30 day period to ensure you\u2019re happy with every\naspect of your policy.\nDuring this time, you can contact us and cancel your policy.\nIf we receive your request to cancel your policy within the\n30 day period after the policy commencement date or\nrenewal date and as long as you\u2019ve not made a claim or\nintend to make a claim, we\u2019ll give you a refund of any monies\nreceived since that date. We may also deduct any taxes or\nduties that we\u2019re unable to refund.\nIf you\u2019ve made a claim during the cooling off period and\nwish to cancel your policy, then any refund will be in\naccordance with provisions set out in the \u201cCancellation by\nyou\u201d section.\nAfter the cooling off period ends, you\u2019ll still be able to cancel\nyour policy and you have rights upon cancellation in certain\ncircumstances under the policy. See the \u201cCancellation by\nyou\u201d section for more information.\n38\nYour privacy\nRenewals of Petinsurance.com.au policies first issued before\n7 November 2023\nHollard, PIPL and PetSure (each a \u2018Recipient\u2019 and referred\nto as \u2018we\u2019, \u2018us\u2019 or \u2018our\u2019 in this Privacy section) are subject to\nthe Australian Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act 1988\n(Cth).\nAll other Petinsurance.com.au policies\nPIPL and PetSure (each a \u2018Recipient\u2019 and referred to as\n\u2018we\u2019, \u2018us\u2019 or \u2018our\u2019 in this Privacy section) are subject to the\nAustralian Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act 1988\n(Cth).\nIn connection with each Recipient:\n\u2022 personal information is collected in various ways,\nincluding via telephone, our website, hard copy forms\nor email.

Words that are italicised\nin this booklet have the special meaning explained in this\nsection.\nBenefit limit and Sub-limit(s) means as follows:\nBenefit limit means the applicable maximum amount\npayable by us in any one policy period, for your cover.\nSub-limit(s) means the applicable maximum amount(s)\npayable by us in any one policy period, for particular items,\ntreatments or specified conditions that you have cover for.\nThe amounts of your benefit limit and sub-limit(s), together\nwith particular items subject to sub-limit(s) are specified on\nyour certificate of insurance.\nAlso note:\n\u2022 we\u2019ll never pay more than the overall annual benefit limit\nor sub-limit specified on your certificate of insurance.\nThis means that if a sub-limit applies for a particular\nitem of cover, specified condition or treatment, we won\u2019t\npay more than that amount, either on an individual or\nper claim basis for that item. This is also subject to the\noverall benefit limit or other relevant sub-limit not having\nbeen exceeded.\n\u2022 the benefit limit and sub-limits are reset when you\nrenew your policy. This means that policy benefits don\u2019t\naccumulate across policy periods. They expire at the end\nof each policy period.\n\u2022 the benefit limit and sub-limits are also subject to the\nexcess (if any) applicable to your cover.\n49\nBenefit percentage means the stated percentage of each\nclaim for eligible vet expenses and eligible costs for covered\nitems which we reimburse, subject to the applicable benefit\nlimit or sub-limit and excesses. The applicable benefit\npercentage will be shown on your certificate of insurance.\nNote: The benefit percentage does not apply to routine care\nitems.\nBilateral condition means any condition affecting body parts\non each side of your pet\u2019s body, e.g. ears, eyes, knees or\nelbows.\nA bilateral condition is considered a single condition or\nspecified condition when applying a benefit limit, sub-limit,\nexcess (if any) or exclusion.\nExample 1: if your pet had an ear infection in the left ear\nprior to the commencement date of the first policy period\nor during the applicable waiting period, and this falls within\nthe definition of a pre-existing condition, a subsequent ear\ninfection in the right ear will still be considered a pre-existing\ncondition.\nExample 2: if your pet suffers from a patella luxation in its\nleft hind leg and arthritis in its right hind leg, this is not a\nbilateral condition. Patella luxations and arthritis aren\u2019t the\nsame condition.\nCancer means a condition in which any cell or group of cells\nin the body of your pet undergoes malignant transformation.\nCertificate of insurance is the certificate we provide you that\noutlines the key details of the contract of insurance between\nyou and us. It includes the policy number, cover, excess (if\nany), commencement date, end date, insured pet details, and\nthe schedule of benefits, including benefit limits, sub-limits\nand dental illness limit (if applicable).\nNote: A certificate of insurance is issued to you when we\naccept your application for cover, on each renewal, and\nwhenever your policy is amended.\nChronic condition means a long-lasting condition which\nis recurring or present in your pet over a period greater\nthan three months in total, however the three-month\nperiod need not be consecutive. Chronic conditions may\nalso be intermittent or managed with medication and/or\nprescription diets with intervals of remission.\n50\nExamples include (but aren\u2019t limited to): chronic or\nseasonal allergies, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes,\nosteoarthritis, cancer and some autoimmune diseases.\nIf a chronic condition is a pre-existing condition, it will\nalways be excluded from cover. That means, it will never be\nconsidered a temporary condition.\nCommencement date unless otherwise specified, is the date\nwhen cover for your pet started in the current policy period\nas shown on your certificate of insurance. The start time is\n11:59PM on that date.\nNote: Also see the first policy period definition for\ncommencement date of first policy period.\nCondition means a condition resulting from an accidental\ninjury or manifestation of an illness.\nNote: Only conditions that are specified conditions, and/or\nspecified dental conditions (where covered under the dental\nillness benefit) are eligible for cover under your policy. See\ndefinition of a specified condition.\nConsultation and other derivations means an examination\nperformed by or under the supervision of a vet, including\na physical consultation, inpatient examination, in-hospital\nexamination, health certificate, consultation or recheck\nconsultation/visit, referral/specialist consultation/visits,\nphone consultation, web consultation and emergency and\nafter-hours consultations/visits.\nNote: Any applicable sub-limit will be shown on your\ncertificate of insurance.\nCover means:\n\u2022 the benefit limit, sub-limits, excess (if any), benefit\npercentage and any other optional or additional benefits\n(including their limits) applicable to your selected policy;\nand\n\u2022 the cover applicable under your policy for your selected\nplan and any previous policies you\u2019ve held with us where\nthe same or a substantially similar or a higher level of\ncover was provided in the current policy period, without\nany break or time without holding the cover.\nNote: The cover for the Bronze Cover for Indoor Cat plan\ncomprises of specified conditions cover, the additional\nbenefits and if selected, the optional benefits.\n51\nDental illness benefit means the dental illness benefit\ndescribed in the \u201cAdditional and optional benefits\u201d section\nwhich provides benefits, up to the dental illness limit, for\neligible vet expenses incurred in relation to specified dental\nconditions.\nDental illness limit means the dental illness limit amount\nspecified on your certificate of insurance, for the dental\nillness benefit.\nIf you have the dental illness benefit, note:\n\u2022 we\u2019ll never pay more than the dental illness limit\nspecified on your certificate of insurance.\n\u2022 the dental illness limit resets if you renew your policy.\nThis means that policy benefits for the dental illness\nbenefit don\u2019t accumulate across policy periods. They\nexpire at the end of each policy period.\n\u2022 the dental illness limit is also subject to the excess (if\nany) applicable to your cover.\nElective treatment means a treatment or surgery that is\nbeneficial to your pet but is not essential for your pet\u2019s\nsurvival and doesn\u2019t form part of the treatment for a covered\nspecified condition and/or specified dental condition.\nEnd date is the date when your policy terminates. No further\nbenefits or entitlements can be paid under the policy for vet\nexpenses or other claims expenses incurred after the end\ndate. The end time is 11:59PM on that date.\nUnless otherwise specified, this relates to the end date of\nyour current policy period.\nThe end date is shown on your certificate of insurance. If\nthe policy is cancelled, then the date of cancellation will be\ndeemed to be the end date.\nExcess means an amount you contribute towards the cost of\nyour claim(s), as shown on your certificate of insurance. The\nexcess is calculated on a \u2018per condition, per policy period\u2019\nbasis. We do this for each condition treated that is unrelated\nto any other condition during the same policy period. Your\nexcess also applies to each emergency boarding claim event.\nThe excess will be deducted from your calculated claim\nbenefits after we apply any benefit limit, sub-limit and the\nbenefit percentage to your claimed amount.\nPet means the cat covered under the policy and named on\nyour certificate of insurance.\nPolicy period means the time during which we provide cover\nas specified on your certificate of insurance.\nNote: Unless otherwise specified, this relates to your current\npolicy period.\nPre-existing condition means a condition that first existed or\noccurred:\n\u2022 prior to the commencement date of the first policy\nperiod; or\n\u2022 within any applicable waiting period; AND\n\u2022 of which you were aware of, or a reasonable person in\nyour circumstances would have been aware, irrespective\nof whether the underlying or causative condition has\nbeen diagnosed.\nA pre-existing condition also includes a related condition or\nbilateral condition of a pre-existing condition.\nRelated condition means a condition that results from the\nsame disease process, arises as a consequence of or has\nthe same diagnostic classification as another condition,\nregardless of the number of areas of your pet\u2019s body that\nare affected.\nExamples\n\u2022 if your pet suffers from arthritis in its leg, all future\noccurrences of arthritis, e.g. in the back or neck, will be\nrelated conditions.\n\u2022 if your pet suffers from diabetes and then develops a\ncataract as a consequence of the diabetes, the cataract\nwill then be a related condition.\nRoutine care means certain pet care items for your pet listed\non your certificate of insurance which are non-insurance\nbenefits. If you have these benefits, the list of allowable\nitems and the maximum amount payable during the policy\nperiod, are shown on your certificate of insurance.\n53\nSpecified condition means the following specified\nconditions:\n\u2022 cancer;\n\u2022 feline lower urinary tract disease;\n\u2022 gastrointestinal problems;\n\u2022 ingestion of a foreign object;\n\u2022 poisoning;\n\u2022 diabetes;\n\u2022 hyperthyroidism;\n\u2022 heart disease;\n\u2022 outer and inner ear infections;\n\u2022 arthritis; and\n\u2022 renal disease.\nNote: Specified conditions don\u2019t include specified dental\nconditions.

See the \u201cPre-\nbe covered, subject to your policy terms and conditions.\nTreatment means reasonable and customary treatment\nincluding hospitalisation, surgery, x-rays, medication,\ndiagnostic tests, nursing and other care and procedures\nincluding consultations provided by a vet to relieve or cure a\nspecified condition, and/or specified dental condition during\nthe policy period.\n54\nVet means any veterinarian, veterinary specialist, animal\nhospital, animal clinic, or animal surgery, other than yourself,\nwho is licensed in and currently registered in Australia.\nVet expenses means the reasonable and essential expenses\nincurred in respect of treatment provided by a vet during the\npolicy period, considering the circumstances in which the\ntreatment was provided.\nWaiting period means the period that your pet is not\ncovered as specified in the Waiting periods section of this\nbooklet, and starts from the commencement date of your\nfirst policy period in which you obtained cover for the\napplicable condition or benefit.\nNote: For more information, see the \u201cWaiting periods\u201d\nsection.\n55\nCONTACT\nDETAILS\nPetinsurance.com.au\nGeneral enquiries, pre-approvals, etc.\nPhone: 1300 855 663\nMonday to Friday 8:00AM to 8:00PM\n(except public holidays)\nEmail: petinsurance@petsure.com.au\nMail: Petinsurance.com.au\nLocked Bag 9021, Castle Hill, NSW 1765\nWebsite: www.petinsurance.com.au\nPrivacy enquiries\nPhone: 1300 855 663\nMonday to Friday 8:00AM to 8:00PM\n(except public holidays)\nEmail: privacy@petinsurance.com.au\nMail: Petinsurance.com.au\nLocked Bag 9021, Castle Hill, NSW 1765\nWebsite: www.petinsurance.com.au\nComplaints\nPhone: 1300 855 663\nMonday to Friday 8:00AM to 8:00PM\n(except public holidays)\nMail: Customer Service Complaints\nPetinsurance.com.au\nLocked Bag 9021, Castle Hill, NSW 1765\nWebsite: www.petinsurance.com.au\nPetSure\nPrivacy enquiries\nPhone: (02) 9842 4800\nEmail: privacy@petsure.com.au\nMail: PetSure (Australia) Pty Ltd\nLocked Bag 9021, Castle Hill, NSW 1765\nWebsite: www.petsure.com.au\nHollard (for renewing policies first issued before 7 November 2023)\nPrivacy enquiries\nPhone: (02) 9253 6600\nEmail: privacy@hollard.com.au\nMail: The Hollard Insurance Company Pty Ltd\nLocked bag 2010, St Leonards, NSW 1590\nWebsite: www.hollard.com.au\n56\n57\n\u2022 This Combined Financial Services Guide and\nProduct Disclosure Statement was prepared on\n12 March 2024.\n\u2022\n\u2022 (02C)_pinscom2_12032024\n",

We\u2019ll then respond\nto you (and your vet if submitted on your behalf) in writing\nwith the outcome. A pre-approval isn\u2019t valid unless we\u2019ve\nagreed to it in writing.\nNote: If we agree to a pre-approval but the treatment\nprovided by your vet differs from the treatment request in\nthe pre-approval, then our assessment of the amount we\ncover under your claim may vary from the notified pre-\napproval amount. A variation in the amount we cover may\nalso occur if you have reached your benefit limit, sub-limit\nor other applicable limit on the claim.\nand calculates your pet insurance claim benefits while you\u2019re\nstill at the vet. If your vet is GapOnly\u00ae enabled, you don\u2019t\nneed to pay your vet in full prior to the submission of your\nclaim. Instead, your vet submits the claim to us electronically\non your behalf and you agree to pay the \u2018gap\u2019 (the difference\nbetween the vet\u2019s invoice and the claim benefit calculated, if\nany, under your policy).\nYou must pay the gap to your treating vet at the time you\nmake a GapOnly\u00ae claim. We\u2019ll then pay the claim benefit (if\nany) directly to your vet.\nYou can find more information on GapOnly\u00ae here: www.\ngaponly.com.au.\nGapOnly\u00ae claim, we\u2019ll pay the claim benefits to you, not your\nvet.\n26\nYou agree that we\u2019re authorised to discuss with your vet, the\ndetails relating to your claim or the treatment provided to\nyour pet in relation to a claim made under your policy. You\nalso agree that your vet is authorised to view the outcome\nof your claim, including the amount of claims benefits.\nPlease note that:\n\u2022 in some instances, we may require more information to\nprocess your claim, such as previous medical history or\npathology/laboratory results. We\u2019ll contact you or your\nvet if required;\n\u2022 there may be situations where we request additional\nveterinary history from current or previous vets, e.g. if\nthere\u2019s a large history gap, to ensure we have all relevant\nclinical information for your pet;\n\u2022 for adopted pets, veterinary history is only required from\nwhen you took ownership. You\u2019ll need to provide us with\nproof of adoption or transfer of ownership papers;\n\u2022 if you\u2019re making an emergency boarding claim, we may\nrequire supporting documentation;\n\u2022 unless we agree otherwise, all of your claims must\ninclude itemised tax invoice(s), payment receipt(s) and\nvet consultation notes if applicable;\n\u2022 incomplete claim forms may result in a processing\ndelay. We recommend that you retain copies of all\ndocumentation for your records;\n\u2022 you also agree that your current or previous vet or any\nother service provider that provided treatments to your\npet is authorised to release information and/or records\nto us about your pet; and\n\u2022 you\u2019re responsible for any fees and expenses that may\nbe charged to you by any third parties relating to the\npurchase and administration of your policy, assistance\nprovided to you to complete any forms and in relation to\nclaims.\nAdjustment of claim payments\nIf the vet expenses incurred by you exceed what is\nreasonable and essential, having regard to other vet\nexpenses in a similar situation, your claim payments may be\nadjusted and paid based on the reasonable and essential\ntreatment or fees typically charged for the treatment, for a\npet in similar circumstances.\n27\nSettlement of your claim\nWe\u2019ll send you a remittance advice regarding the settlement\nof your claim, either by email or letter, depending on your\nchosen means to communicate with us. This advice provides\ndetails of your claim outcome and how your claim has been\nprocessed. For Hollard issued policies, all approved benefits\nwill be paid into your nominated bank account or by cheque.\nFor PetSure issued policies, we\u2019ll pay all approved benefits\ninto your nominated bank account.\nWe reserve the right to deduct from the benefit amount any\namount due to us, for example for any overdue premium\npayments.\nNote: In the event that we pay a benefit contrary to the\npolicy terms and conditions for whatever reason, this won\u2019t\nconstitute a waiver of our rights to apply the policy terms\nand conditions retrospectively to any paid claims or to any\nfuture claims for that or any related condition.\nWe also reserve our right to recover from you any benefit\namount received by you as a result of such error.\nDeclining to process your claim\nIf you or your vet refuse to or are unable to provide\ninformation reasonably requested by us to process your\nclaim, we may decline or reduce the amount payable for\nyour claim, in accordance with relevant law.\nFraudulent claims\nIf you submit a fraudulent claim or entice your vet to behave\nin a fraudulent manner regarding a claim, then the claim may\nbe denied or reduced in accordance with relevant law, and\nwe may cancel your policy altogether in the event you make\na fraudulent claim. We may also be entitled to reclaim any\npayments already made to you in respect of such claims.\nFor more details, see the \u201cHow we prevent or handle fraud\u201d\nsection.\n28\nHow we settle your claim\nThe best way to show you how we work out how much we\npay after you make a claim is with a couple of examples.\nThese are examples only and include GST.\nExample 1\nThis is a simple case showing how the policy benefit\npercentage and excess is applied.\n80% benefit percentage and $250 excess option selected\nThe eligible invoice amount from your vet for $6,000\ntreatment\nThe amount you can claim after applying $4,800\nyour benefit percentage\nLess $250 excess ($250)\nHow much we pay $4,550\nYour total out-of-pocket expense including $1,450\nyour excess\nExample 2\nThis one shows how a claim is paid for a policy item where a\nsub-limit and excess applies.\nClaim for emergency boarding.\n80% benefit percentage with a $1,000 emergency\nboarding sub-limit per policy period and $250 excess\noption selected\nThe eligible invoice amount for emergency $1,400\nboarding\nThe amount you can claim after applying your $1,000\nbenefit percentage and emergency boarding\nsub-limit\nLess $250 excess ($250)\nHow much we pay $750\nYour total out-of-pocket expense including $650\nyour excess\n29\nOur right to recover other amounts payable\nIf we have the right to recover any amount payable under\nyour policy in relation to a claim from any other person, you\nmust provide reasonable cooperation with us in any action\nwe may take.\nTelling us about other insurance you have\nIf you hold other insurance under which you may be entitled\nto make a claim in relation to eligible vet expenses, you must\nadvise us of this at the time you submit your claim. Total\nbenefits paid to you across all insurance cannot exceed your\nactual expenses.\nHow we prevent or handle fraud\nUnfortunately, fraud and attempted fraud can occur. We\nemploy sophisticated fraud detection and prevention\ntechniques to ensure we only pay genuine claims. By doing\nthis we\u2019re protecting you and all our policyholders.\nYou must not act in a fraudulent manner. If you or anyone\nacting for you:\n\u2022 makes a claim, submits a document, or makes a\nstatement in support of a claim under the policy\nknowing the claim, document or statement to be false or\nfraudulently exaggerated in any respect;\n\u2022 works with your vet to behave in a fraudulent manner\nregarding a claim, e.g. pressuring your vet to note\nincorrect information; or\n\u2022 makes a claim in respect of any loss or damage caused\nby your willful act or by colluding with another person;\nThen:\n\u2022 we may be entitled to refuse to pay all or part of the\nclaim, to the extent permitted by law;\n\u2022 we may cancel your policy and any other insurance\npolicies you hold with us;\n\u2022 we may be entitled to reclaim any payments already\nmade to you in respect of such claims;\n\u2022 we may not refund a premium already paid; or\n\u2022 we may inform the police of the circumstances and we\nmay take legal action.\n30\n6\nPAYING YOUR\nPREMIUM\nYour insurance policy cover is provided on the basis that\nyou\u2019ve paid or agreed to pay us the premium for that\ncover. The amount you pay is shown on your certificate of\ninsurance. It includes all premium, administration fees and\nany applicable discounts, government taxes, fees and/or\ncharges.\nWe like to think we don\u2019t miss a thing, but if you have a\nquestion about anything on your certificate of insurance,\nplease contact us.\nHow to pay\nYour pet insurance premium is payable when you take out a\nnew policy and subsequently when your policy is renewed.\nPremiums can be paid via direct debit through a credit card\nor bank account:\n\u2022 annually;\nOR\n\u2022 in monthly or fortnightly instalments.\nWhen premiums are paid in monthly or fortnightly\ninstalments, you\u2019ll be charged a collection fee per instalment,\nthe amount of which will be displayed on your certificate of\ninsurance.\nIf we accept and pay a claim under your policy, we may\ndeduct the balance of any outstanding premium from the\nclaim payment.\nPaying on time\nYou need to make sure your premium payment(s) are up to\ndate. If you have a policy that you\u2019re paying by instalments\nand we haven\u2019t received an instalment payment by its due\ndate, we\u2019ll send you a notice in writing by mail, email or text\nmessage about your non-payment.\nThis will be at least 14 calendar days before any cancellation\nof your policy for non-payment.\n31\nIf we don\u2019t receive the instalment payment after sending this\nnotice, we\u2019ll send you a second notice in writing, again by\nmail, email or text message.\nThis will happen either:\n\u2022 prior to cancellation of your policy, informing you\nthat your instalment policy is being cancelled for non-\npayment if the unpaid premium remains in arrears for\nmore than one month;\nOR\n\u2022 within 14 calendar days after cancellation by us,\nconfirming our cancellation of your instalment policy\nafter the unpaid premium was in arrears for at least one\nmonth.\nIf one or more instalments has remained unpaid for a period\nof at least 14 calendar days, then we reserve the right to\nreduce any claim made on the policy by the amount of any\noutstanding premium.\nCancellation consequences\nIf we cancel your policy due to non-payment of an\ninstalment premium, please be aware that:\n\u2022 no benefits or entitlements can be paid under the policy\nfor vet expenses or other claims expenses incurred after\nthe cancellation date;\n\u2022 you may be refused cover in the future under any policy\nadministered by PetSure; and\n\u2022 any application for general insurance products (with any\nprovider) in the future may be affected because you had\na policy cancelled because of unpaid premiums.\n32\nYour payment account\nWhen you provide us with your nominated credit card or\nbank account details, we use these to directly debit the\npremium calculated by us from that card or account.\nUnless you opt out of automatic renewals or tell us that you\ndon\u2019t want to renew your policy, we\u2019ll deduct/charge the\nrenewal premium from your nominated credit card or bank\naccount.\nIf your premium can\u2019t be paid, e.g. there isn\u2019t enough money\nin your nominated account, you may be charged a fee by\nyour bank. It\u2019s important that you know that neither Hollard\nnor PetSure will be responsible for fees charged by your\nbank or financial institution.\nIf your direct debit fails, we\u2019ll notify you of this and\nautomatically retry for the outstanding amount within\n14 calendar days. Should this second attempt fail, we\u2019ll\ntry again after 14 calendar days and, depending on your\npayment frequency, we\u2019ll deduct either the outstanding\namount, or the outstanding amount together with your\nregular instalment.\nIf you\u2019d like to make a real-time payment of your\noutstanding balance before we reattempt a direct debit, just\ncall us to do this.\nFor payments by direct debit\nFor Hollard issued policies, if the direct debit bank account is\nnot yours, you confirm you have the authority of the account\nholder to use it and that they\u2019ve agreed to these terms.\nFor PetSure issued policies, you must have the sole authority\nas the account holder of the direct debit bank account and\nagree to the Direct Debit Request Service Agreement.\nFor payments by credit card\nIf the credit card is not yours, you confirm you have the\nauthority of the credit card account holder to use it and that\nthey\u2019ve agreed to these terms.\nShould you have questions about the operation of the direct\ndebit authority or you need to change any aspects of the\nauthority, please contact us.\n33\n7\nRENEWALS,\nCANCELLATIONS\n& CHANGES\nThis part of the booklet explains your options for renewing,\ncancelling or changing the cover for your pet insurance\npolicy.\nAnnual renewal of your insurance policy\nAs long as we continue to provide the product, we\u2019ll offer\nrenewal of your policy every year.

It is very important that you do so, as we base\nour decision whether to provide cover and the terms on\nwhich we do so on your answers.\n37\nIf you\u2019re not sure of the answers to any of our questions,\nyou should take the time to find them. It\u2019s also important\nto understand that, in answering the questions, you\u2019re\nanswering for yourself and anyone else to whom the\nquestions apply.\nIf any of our questions aren\u2019t clear and you need help, please\ncontact us.\nWhen this duty applies\nThe duty to take reasonable care not to make a\nmisrepresentation also applies before you renew, vary,\nextend or reinstate an existing contract of insurance. This\nmeans that you must inform us of any changes to the\ninformation set out in your certificate of insurance, where the\ninformation is no longer honest, accurate and complete. If\nyou don\u2019t contact us to update this information, we\u2019ll take it\nthat you agree that the information remains honest, accurate\nand complete. Please contact us if you have any doubts.\nIf you don\u2019t comply with your duty\nIf you don\u2019t take reasonable care in answering our questions\nor inform us of changes to the information set out in\nyour policy documents, you may breach your duty. If that\nhappens, your policy may be cancelled, or treated as if it\nnever existed, and any claim may be denied or not paid in\nfull.\nUpdates to the PDS\nWe may need to update this PDS from time to time when\ncertain changes occur and where we\u2019re required and\npermitted by law to do so. If that happens, we\u2019ll issue you\nwith a new PDS or a Supplementary PDS or other compliant\ndocument to update the relevant information.\nWhere the information isn\u2019t materially adverse from the\npoint of view of a reasonable person considering whether\nto buy or continue to hold this insurance, we may issue you\nwith notice in a different form, including but not limited to\ndisclosure updates on the PetSure and/or\nPetinsurance.com.au website(s).\nYou can contact us to get a free paper copy or download an\nelectronic copy that summarises these changes.\nHow we calculate your premium\nYour premium is calculated when your Petinsurance.com.au\npolicy begins, at each policy anniversary, and also if you vary\nyour cover. The premium for each policy period is printed on\nyour certificate of insurance.\n38\nThe amount you pay also includes allowances for\ngovernment fees, taxes and charges, including stamp duty\nand GST.\nFor new policies\nWe calculate your premium based on several factors. Some\nare pre-set and don\u2019t vary, e.g. amounts we consider for\nsome internal expenses. Others can affect the premium\namount depending on whether we believe it increases or\ndecreases the risk to us. For example, the type of cover and\noptions you have selected.\nWe\u2019ll also take into account risk factors associated with\nyou and your pet such as your pet\u2019s breed and age. For\ninstance, as your pet gets older the risk of your pet requiring\ntreatment will increase and so the premium increases.\nThere are also commercial factors that affect your premium,\nincluding costs associated with operating our business and\nour commercial arrangements.\nYour premium calculation may also include discounts or\npromotional offers that we provide. If you qualify for two or\nmore discounts, we apply a specific order to our calculation\nof your final premium.\nAlso, any discounts and/or your premium may be rounded\nup or down and some may only apply in the first year of\ncoverage.\nFor renewals and changes to your policy\nFor renewals, we also factor in the claim history for your pet\nand the average cost of care for pets like yours, as well as\nthe claims experience across all our insured pets. Because of\nall of these factors and the changes to your pet\u2019s risk profile,\nyour premium will increase from year to year.\nWhen calculating your premium on renewal, we also\nconsider how much your premium was previously, including\nany discounts that may have been applied. This means that\nwe may limit movements up or down.\nThese same factors and others are also used to calculate\nyour premium if you amend your coverage.\nFor information about how and when to pay your premium,\nplease read the \u201cPaying your premium\u201d section.\n39\nCooling off period\nYou have a 30 day period to ensure you\u2019re happy with every\naspect of your policy.\nDuring this time, you can contact us and cancel your policy.\nIf we receive your request to cancel your policy within the\n30 day period after the policy commencement date or\nrenewal date and as long as you\u2019ve not made a claim or\nintend to make a claim, we\u2019ll give you a refund of any monies\nreceived since that date.

Words that are italicised\nin this booklet have the special meaning explained in this\nsection.\nBenefit limit and Sub-limit(s) means as follows:\nBenefit limit means the applicable maximum amount\npayable by us in any one policy period, for your cover.\nSub-limit(s) means the applicable maximum amount(s)\npayable by us in any one policy period, for particular items,\ntreatments or conditions that you have cover for.\nThe amounts of your benefit limit and sub-limit(s), together\nwith particular items subject to sub-limit(s) are specified on\nyour certificate of insurance.\nAlso note:\n\u2022 we\u2019ll never pay more than the overall annual benefit limit\nor sub-limit specified on your certificate of insurance.\nThis means that if a sub-limit applies for a particular item\nof cover, condition or treatment, we won\u2019t pay more than\nthat amount, either on an individual or per claim basis for\nthat item. This is also subject to the overall benefit limit\nor other relevant sub-limit not having been exceeded.\n\u2022 the benefit limit and sub-limits are reset when you\nrenew your policy. This means that policy benefits don\u2019t\naccumulate across policy periods. They expire at the end\nof each policy period.\n\u2022 the benefit limit and sub-limits are also subject to the\nexcess (if any) applicable to your cover.\n51\nBenefit percentage means the stated percentage of each\nclaim for eligible vet expenses and eligible costs for covered\nitems which we reimburse, subject to the applicable benefit\nlimit or sub-limit and excesses. The applicable benefit\npercentage will be shown on your certificate of insurance.\nNote: The benefit percentage does not apply to routine care\nitems.\nBilateral condition means any condition affecting body parts\non each side of your pet\u2019s body, e.g. ears, eyes, knees or\nelbows.\nA bilateral condition is considered a single condition\nwhen applying a benefit limit, sub-limit, excess (if any) or\nexclusion.\nExample 1: if your pet displays signs or symptoms of a\ncruciate ligament condition in the left knee prior to the\ncommencement date of the first policy period or during the\napplicable waiting period, and this falls within the definition\nof a pre-existing condition, a subsequent cruciate ligament\ncondition in the right knee will still be considered a pre-\nexisting condition.\nExample 2: if your pet suffers from a cruciate ligament\ncondition in its left hind leg and patella luxation in its right\nhind leg, this is not a bilateral condition. Cruciate ligament\nconditions and patella luxation aren\u2019t the same condition.\nCertificate of insurance is the certificate we provide you that\noutlines the key details of the contract of insurance between\nyou and us. It includes the policy number, cover, excess (if\nany), commencement date, end date, insured pet details, and\nthe schedule of benefits, including benefit limits, sub-limits\nand dental illness limit (if applicable).\nNote: A certificate of insurance is issued to you when we\naccept your application for cover, on each renewal, and\nwhenever your policy is amended.\nChronic condition means a long-lasting condition which\nis recurring or present in your pet over a period greater\nthan three months in total, however the three-month\nperiod need not be consecutive. Chronic conditions may\nalso be intermittent or managed with medication and/or\nprescription diets with intervals of remission.\n52\nExamples include (but aren\u2019t limited to): chronic or\nseasonal allergies, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes,\nosteoarthritis, cancer and some autoimmune diseases.\nIf a chronic condition is a pre-existing condition, it will\nalways be excluded from cover. That means, it will never be\nconsidered a temporary condition.\nCommencement date unless otherwise specified, is the date\nwhen cover for your pet started in the current policy period\nas shown on your certificate of insurance. The start time is\n11:59PM on that date.\nNote: Also see the first policy period definition for\ncommencement date of first policy period.\nCondition means a condition resulting from an accidental\ninjury or manifestation of an illness.\nNote: Only conditions that are specified accidental injuries,\nspecified illnesses and/or specified dental conditions (where\ncovered under the dental illness benefit) are eligible for\ncover under your policy.\nConsultation and other derivations means an examination\nperformed by or under the supervision of a vet, including\na physical consultation, inpatient examination, in-hospital\nexamination, health certificate, consultation or recheck\nconsultation/visit, referral/specialist consultation/visits,\nphone consultation, web consultation and emergency and\nafter-hours consultations/visits.\nNote: Any applicable sub-limit will be shown on your\ncertificate of insurance.\nCover means:\n\u2022 the benefit limit, sub-limits, excess (if any), benefit\npercentage and any other optional or additional benefits\n(including their limits) applicable to your selected policy;\nand\n\u2022 the cover applicable under your policy for your selected\nplan and any previous policies you\u2019ve held with us where\nthe same or a substantially similar or a higher level of\ncover was provided in the current policy period, without\nany break or time without holding the cover.\nNote: Your certificate of insurance tells you which plan\nyou have. The cover for your plan comprises of specified\naccidental injury cover, specified illness cover, additional\nbenefits and any selected optional benefits.\n53\nCruciate ligament condition means partial or complete\nrupture of the cruciate ligament(s). This includes meniscal\ntears, any looseness of the cruciate ligaments, along with\nany complications following treatment for this condition.\nDental illness benefit means the dental illness benefit\ndescribed in the \u201cAdditional and optional benefits\u201d section\nwhich provides benefits, up to the dental illness limit, for\neligible vet expenses incurred in relation to specified dental\nconditions.\nDental illness limit means the dental illness limit amount\nspecified on your certificate of insurance which is additional\nto your policy\u2019s benefit limit.\nIf you have the dental illness benefit, also note:\n\u2022 we\u2019ll never pay more than the dental illness limit\nspecified on your certificate of insurance.\n\u2022 the dental illness limit resets if you renew your policy.\nThis means that policy benefits for the dental illness\nbenefit don\u2019t accumulate across policy periods. They\nexpire at the end of each policy period.\n\u2022 the dental illness limit is also subject to the excess (if\nany) applicable to your cover.\nElective treatment means a treatment or surgery that is\nbeneficial to your pet but is not essential for your pet\u2019s\nsurvival and doesn\u2019t form part of the treatment for a covered\ncondition.\nEnd date is the date when your policy terminates. No further\nbenefits or entitlements can be paid under the policy for vet\nexpenses or other claims expenses incurred after the end\ndate. The end time is 11:59PM on that date.\nUnless otherwise specified, this relates to the end date of\nyour current policy period.\nThe end date is shown on your certificate of insurance. If\nthe policy is cancelled, then the date of cancellation will be\ndeemed to be the end date.\n54\nExcess means an amount you contribute towards the cost of\nyour claim(s), as shown on your certificate of insurance. The\nexcess is calculated on a \u2018per condition, per policy period\u2019\nbasis. We do this for each condition treated that is unrelated\nto any other condition during the same policy period.

We\u2019ll then respond to you (and your\nvet if submitted on your behalf) in writing with the outcome. A\npre-approval isn\u2019t valid unless we\u2019ve agreed to it in writing.\nNote: If we agree to a pre-approval but the treatment provided\nby your vet differs from the treatment request in the pre-\napproval, then our assessment of the amount we cover under\nyour claim may vary from the notified pre-approval amount. A\nvariation in the amount we cover may also occur if you have\nreached your benefit limit, sub-limit (if applicable), extra care\nlimit (if applicable), or routine care limits (if applicable) on the\nclaim.\nand calculates your pet insurance claim benefits while you\u2019re\nstill at the vet. If your vet is GapOnly\u00ae enabled, you don\u2019t need\nto pay your vet in full prior to the submission of your claim.\n24\nInstead, your vet submits the claim to us electronically on your\nbehalf and you agree to pay the \u2018gap\u2019 (the difference between\nthe vet\u2019s invoice and the claim benefit calculated, if any, under\nyour policy).\nYou must pay the gap to your treating vet at the time you make\na GapOnly\u00ae claim. We\u2019ll then pay the claim benefit (if any)\ndirectly to your vet.\nYou can find more information on GapOnly\u00ae here:\nwww.gaponly.com.au\nwe\u2019ll pay the claim benefits to you, not your vet.\nYou agree that we\u2019re authorised to discuss with your vet, the\ndetails relating to your claim or the treatment provided to your\npet in relation to a claim made under your policy. You also agree\nthat your vet is authorised to view the outcome of your claim,\nincluding the amount of claims benefits.\nPlease note that:\n\u2022 in some instances, we may require more information to\nprocess your claim, such as previous medical history or\npathology/laboratory results. We\u2019ll contact you or your vet if\nrequired;\n25\n\u2022 there may be situations where we request additional\nveterinary history from current or previous vets, e.g. if\nthere\u2019s a large history gap, to ensure we have all relevant\nclinical information for your pet;\n\u2022 for adopted pets, veterinary history is only required from\nwhen you took ownership. You\u2019ll need to provide us with\nproof of adoption or transfer of ownership papers;\n\u2022 if you\u2019re making an emergency pet boarding claim, we may\nrequire supporting documentation;\n\u2022 unless we agree otherwise, all of your claims must include\nitemised tax invoice(s), payment receipt(s) and vet\nconsultation notes if applicable;\n\u2022 incomplete claim forms may result in a processing delay.\nWe recommend that you retain copies of all documentation\nfor your records;\n\u2022 you also agree that your current or previous vet or any\nother service provider that provided treatments to your pet\nis authorised to release information and/or records to us\nabout your pet; and\n\u2022 you\u2019re responsible for any fees and expenses that may be\ncharged to you by any third parties relating to the purchase\nand administration of your policy, assistance provided to\nyou to complete any forms and in relation to claims.\nSettlement of your claim\nWe\u2019ll send you a remittance advice regarding the settlement of\nyour claim by your chosen communication method, outlining\nthe claim outcome and how your claim has been processed.\nIf your claim payment has been settled on the basis that the\ntreatment is not reasonable and customary or that the vet\nexpenses incurred are not reasonable, customary and essential\nexpenses, we will provide you with additional explanation of the\noutcome.\nFor Hollard issued policies, all approved benefits will be paid\ninto your nominated bank account or by cheque. For PetSure\nissued policies, we\u2019ll pay all approved benefits into your\nnominated bank account.\nWe reserve the right to deduct from the benefit amount any\namount due to us, for example for any overdue premium\npayments.\nNote: In the event that we pay a benefit contrary to the policy\nterms and conditions for whatever reason, this won\u2019t constitute\na waiver of our rights to apply the policy terms and conditions\nretrospectively to any paid claims or to any future claims for\nthat or any related condition.\nWe also reserve our right to recover from you any benefit\namount received by you as a result of such error.\n26\nDeclining to process your claim\nIf you or your vet refuse to or are unable to provide information\nreasonably requested by us to process your claim, we may\ndecline or reduce the amount payable for your claim, in\naccordance with relevant law.\nFraudulent claims\nIf you submit a fraudulent claim or entice your vet to behave\nin a fraudulent manner regarding a claim, then the claim may\nbe denied or reduced in accordance with relevant law, and\nwe may cancel your policy altogether in the event you make\na fraudulent claim. We may also be entitled to reclaim any\npayments already made to you in respect of such claims.\nFor more details, see the \u201cHow we prevent or handle fraud\u201d\nsection.\n27\nHow we settle your claim\nThe best way to show you how we work out how much we pay\nafter you make a claim is with a couple of examples. These are\nexamples only and include GST.\nExample 1\nThis is a simple case showing how the policy benefit percentage\nand excess is applied.\n80% benefit percentage and $100 excess option selected\nThe eligible invoice amount from your vet for $2,000\ntreatment\nThe amount you can claim after applying your $1,600\nbenefit percentage\nLess $100 excess ($100)\nHow much we pay $1,500\nYour out-of-pocket expense including your $500\nexcess\nExample 2\nThis one shows how a claim is paid for a policy item where a\nsub-limit and excess applies.\nClaim for hip joint surgery to the left hip.\n70% benefit percentage with a $4,000 hip joint surgery sub-\nlimit per hip per policy period and $250 excess option selected.\nThe eligible invoice amount from your vet for $5,000\ntreatment to the left hip\nThe amount you can claim after applying your $3,500\nbenefit percentage and hip joint surgery sub-\nlimit for the left hip\nLess $250 excess ($250)\nHow much we pay $3,250\nYour out-of-pocket expense including your $1,750\nexcess\n28\nOur right to recover other amounts payable\nIf we have the right to recover any amount payable under your\npolicy in relation to a claim from any other person, you must\nprovide reasonable cooperation with us in any action we may\ntake.\nTelling us about other insurance you have\nIf you hold other insurance under which you may be entitled\nto make a claim in relation to eligible vet expenses, you must\nadvise us of this at the time you submit your claim. Total benefits\npaid to you across all insurance cannot exceed your actual\nexpenses.\nHow we prevent or handle fraud\nUnfortunately, fraud and attempted fraud can occur. We\nemploy sophisticated fraud detection and prevention\ntechniques to ensure we only pay genuine claims. By doing this\nwe\u2019re protecting you and all our policyholders.\nYou must not act in a fraudulent manner. If you or anyone acting\nfor you:\n\u2022 makes a claim, submits a document, or makes a statement\nin support of a claim under the policy knowing the\nclaim, document or statement to be false or fraudulently\nexaggerated in any respect;\n\u2022 works with your vet to behave in a fraudulent manner\nregarding a claim, e.g. pressuring your vet to note incorrect\ninformation; or\n\u2022 makes a claim in respect of any loss or damage caused by\nyour wilful act or by colluding with another person;\nThen:\n\u2022 we may be entitled to refuse to pay all or part of the claim,\nto the extent permitted by law;\n\u2022 we may cancel your policy and any other insurance policies\nyou hold with us;\n\u2022 we may be entitled to reclaim any payments already made\nto you in respect of such claims;\n\u2022 we may not refund a premium already paid; or\n\u2022 we may inform the police of the circumstances and we may\ntake legal action.\n29\n6 Paying your\npremium\nYour insurance policy cover is provided on the basis that\nyou\u2019ve paid or agreed to pay us the premium for that cover.\nThe amount you pay is shown on your certificate of insurance.\nIt includes all premium, administration fees and any applicable\ndiscounts, government taxes, fees and/or charges.\nWe like to think we don\u2019t miss a thing, but if you have a question\nabout anything on your certificate of insurance, please contact\nus.\nHow to pay\nYour pet insurance premium is payable when you take out a new\npolicy and subsequently when your policy is renewed.\nPremiums can be paid via direct debit through a credit card or\nbank account:\n\u2022 annually;\nOR\n\u2022 in monthly or fortnightly instalments.\nWhen premiums are paid in monthly or fortnightly instalments,\nyou\u2019ll be charged a collection fee per instalment, the amount of\nwhich will be displayed on your certificate of insurance.\nIf we accept and pay a claim under your policy, we may deduct\nthe balance of any outstanding premium from the claim\npayment.\nPaying on time\nYou need to make sure your premium payment(s) are up to date.\nIf you have a policy that you\u2019re paying by instalments and we\nhaven\u2019t received an instalment payment by its due date, we\u2019ll\nsend you a notice in writing by mail, email or text message\nabout your non-payment.\nThis will be at least 14 calendar days before any cancellation of\nyour policy for non-payment.\nIf we don\u2019t receive the instalment payment after sending this\nnotice, we\u2019ll send you a second notice in writing, again by mail,\nemail or text message.\n30\nThis will happen either:\n\u2022 prior to cancellation of your policy, informing you that your\ninstalment policy is being cancelled for non-payment if\nthe unpaid premium remains in arrears for more than one\nmonth;\nOR\n\u2022 within 14 calendar days after cancellation by us, confirming\nour cancellation of your instalment policy after the unpaid\npremium was in arrears for at least one month.\nIf one or more instalments has remained unpaid for a period of\nat least 14 calendar days, then we reserve the right to reduce\nany claim made on the policy by the amount of any outstanding\npremium.\nCancellation consequences\nIf we cancel your policy due to non-payment of an instalment\npremium, please be aware that:\n\u2022 no benefits or entitlements will be payable under the policy\nfor vet expenses or other claims expenses incurred after the\ncancellation date;\n\u2022 applications for other general insurance products\nadministered by PetSure may be refused; and\n\u2022 any application for general insurance products (with any\nprovider) in the future may be affected because you had a\npolicy cancelled because of unpaid premiums.\nYour payment account\nWhen you provide us with your nominated credit card or bank\naccount details, we use these to directly debit the premium\ncalculated by us from that card or account.\nUnless you opt out of automatic renewals or tell us that you\ndon\u2019t want to renew your policy, we\u2019ll deduct/charge the\nrenewal premium from your nominated credit card or bank\naccount.\nIf your premium can\u2019t be paid, e.g. there isn\u2019t enough money in\nyour nominated account, you may be charged a fee by your\nbank. It\u2019s important that you know that neither Hollard nor\nPetSure will be responsible for fees charged by your bank or\nfinancial institution.\nIf your direct debit fails, we\u2019ll notify you of this and automatically\nretry for the outstanding amount within 14 calendar days. Should\nthis second attempt fail, we\u2019ll try again after 14 calendar days\nand, depending on your payment frequency, we\u2019ll deduct either\nthe outstanding amount, or the outstanding amount together\nwith your regular instalment.\n31\nIf you\u2019d like to make a real-time payment of your outstanding\nbalance before we reattempt a direct debit, just call us to do\nthis.\nFor payments by direct debit\nFor Hollard issued policies, if the direct debit bank account is\nnot yours, you confirm you have the authority of the account\nholder to use it and that they\u2019ve agreed to these terms.\nFor PetSure issued policies, you must have the sole authority as\nthe account holder of the direct debit bank account and agree\nto the Direct Debit Request Service Agreement.\nFor payments by credit card\nIf the credit card is not yours, you confirm you have the\nauthority of the credit card account holder to use it and that\nthey\u2019ve agreed to these terms.\nShould you have questions about the operation of the direct\ndebit authority or you need to change any aspects of the\nauthority, please contact us.\n32\n7 Renewals,\ncancellations\n& changes\nThis part of the booklet explains your options for renewing,\ncancelling or changing the cover for your pet insurance policy.\nAnnual renewal of your insurance policy\nAs long as we continue to provide the product, we\u2019ll offer\nrenewal of your policy every year. This will be subject to the\napplicable terms and conditions of the policy for each policy\nperiod. We\u2019ll change the premium and may change the terms\nand conditions of the policy at the time of renewal, based on\na combination of factors, including the risk associated with\ninsuring pets like yours.\nRenewal procedure\nWhere we offer renewal of your policy, at least 14 days before\nyour current policy expires, we\u2019ll send you an offer of renewal\nconfirming the expiry date of your policy, and the premium and\nterms on which we\u2019ll offer to renew your insurance for the next\npolicy period.\nUnless you\u2019ve chosen not to automatically renew your policy,\nyour policy will automatically renew on those terms. Where you\nhave opted-out of automatic renewal, you\u2019ll need to contact us\nafter you\u2019ve received your offer of renewal if you\u2019d like to renew\nyour policy.\nThe notice will also remind you:\n\u2022 that you can opt out of the automatic renewal process at\nany time in the future;\n\u2022 to check the information we have on your certificate of\ninsurance is correct; and\n\u2022 to review your insurance cover to consider if the policy limits\nand level of cover are still right for you.\nUnless you opt out of automatic renewals or tell us that you\ndon\u2019t want to renew your policy, we\u2019ll deduct/charge the\nrenewal premium from your nominated account or credit card.\nSee the \u201cYour payment account\u201d section for more information.\n33\nYour premium\nEvery year, we\u2019ll notify you of the changes to your annual\npremium. We review the cost of everyone\u2019s insurance, taking\naccount of a range of factors. These are set out under the \u201cHow\nwe calculate your premium\u201d section.\nCancellation by you\nYou can cancel your policy with us at any time by contacting\nour customer service team. Our \u201cContact details\u201d are on the last\npage of this booklet.\nThe cancellation will be effective once we provide you with a\nwritten confirmation of your request, either by email or letter.\nWe\u2019ll retain the portion of the premium that relates to the period\nthat you\u2019ve been insured up to your cancellation date. Where\nyou have paid for a period in advance (e.g. for the fortnight,\nmonth, or year), we\u2019ll refund that proportion of premium for\nthe time remaining on the policy (less any non-refundable\ngovernment or statutory charges and less any collection fee\ncharges).\nIf your pet passes away\nWe know there is a lot going on when your pet passes away, but\nwe\u2019re here to help. Please contact us as soon as possible and\nwe\u2019ll cancel your policy from the date of your pet\u2019s passing. We\u2019ll\nadjust the premium, as outlined above.\nYour cancellation rights during the cooling off period\nYour cooling off cancellation rights apply when you buy your\npolicy and also exist when your policy renews or is reissued\nfollowing a change in your cover. You can find more information\nin the \u201cCooling off period\u201d section.\nCancellation by us\nWe may cancel your policy where permitted by and in\naccordance with the law. We\u2019ll give you notice in writing before\nexercising any right to cancel your policy. For example, if you:\n\u2022 do not comply with the policy terms and conditions;\n\u2022 do not pay your premium as agreed;\n\u2022 make a fraudulent claim; or\n\u2022 did not comply with your duty to take reasonable care not to\nmake a misrepresentation.\nIf we cancel your policy, we\u2019ll retain and/or refund any premium\nas the law allows us to do so.\n34\nChanging your cover\nYou can change the cover for your pet by choosing cover with\ndifferent or additional benefits, where eligible and available to\nyou. You may, for example, want a different benefit percentage\nor benefit limit, or to upgrade your coverage.\nIf you haven\u2019t had a claim paid and want to change your cover,\njust contact us and we\u2019ll issue you a new policy number and\ncertificate of insurance outlining your new premium and your\nprevious policy number will be cancelled.\nHowever, you can\u2019t change your cover if a claim has been paid\nduring your current policy period. You\u2019ll need to wait until your\nnext policy renewal.\nWaiting periods already completed won\u2019t be reapplied unless\nthere has been a break or lapse in your cover. If you change the\nMedibank Pet Insurance product you have for your pet, with a\ndifferent level of cover, waiting periods will only apply to any\nconditions or benefits covered by the new product that weren\u2019t\ncovered under your previous product.\n35\n8 Other\nimportant\ninformation\nThis section includes other important information on how we\ncommunicate with you, your duty to take reasonable care not to\nmake a misrepresentation, how we calculate your premium and\nmore.\nDelivery of your policy documents\nUnless you instruct us otherwise, we prefer to send your policy\ndocuments and communicate with you electronically. Where\nyou\u2019ve agreed to receive electronic communications, you\u2019ll\nneed to provide us with your email address and mobile number.\nWhen we send your policy documents by email, we\u2019ll consider\nthat you have received them on the date recorded on our\ninformation system.\nYou can instruct us to provide these documents by post, to a\nmailing address you provide, either when you purchase your\npolicy or at any time by contacting us.\nYou\u2019re responsible for making sure the email and postal\naddresses you\u2019ve given us are correct and up-to-date at all\ntimes.\nYour duty to take reasonable care not to make a\nmisrepresentation\nBefore you enter into this contract of insurance with us,\nyou have a duty to take reasonable care not to make a\nmisrepresentation under the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth).\nThis means you need to take reasonable care to provide honest,\naccurate and complete answers to any questions that we ask.\nIt is very important that you do so, as we base our decision\nwhether to provide cover and the terms on which we do so on\nyour answers.\nIf you\u2019re not sure of the answers to any of our questions,\nyou should take the time to find them. It\u2019s also important to\nunderstand that, in answering the questions, you\u2019re answering\nfor yourself and anyone else to whom the questions apply.\nIf any of our questions aren\u2019t clear and you need help, please\ncontact us.\n36\nWhen this duty applies\nThe duty to take reasonable care not to make a\nmisrepresentation also applies before you renew, vary, extend\nor reinstate an existing contract of insurance. This means that\nyou must inform us of any changes to the information set out\nin your certificate of insurance, where the information is no\nlonger honest, accurate and complete. If you don\u2019t contact us\nto update this information, we\u2019ll take it that you agree that the\ninformation remains honest, accurate and complete. Please\ncontact us if you have any doubts.\nIf you don\u2019t comply with your duty\nIf you don\u2019t take reasonable care in answering our questions or\ninform us of changes to the information set out in your policy\ndocuments, you may breach your duty. If that happens, your\npolicy may be cancelled, or treated as if it never existed, and\nany claim may be denied or not paid in full.\nUpdates to the PDS\nWe may need to update this PDS from time to time when certain\nchanges occur and where we\u2019re required and permitted by law\nto do so. If that happens, we\u2019ll issue you with a new PDS or a\nSupplementary PDS or other compliant document to update the\nrelevant information.\nWhere the information isn\u2019t materially adverse from the point\nof view of a reasonable person considering whether to buy or\ncontinue to hold this insurance, we may issue you with notice in\na different form, including but not limited to disclosure updates\non the PetSure and/or Medibank website(s).\nYou can contact us to get a free paper copy or download an\nelectronic copy that summarises these changes.\n37\nHow we calculate your premium\nYour premium is calculated when your Medibank Pet Insurance\npolicy begins, at each policy anniversary, and also if you vary\nyour cover. The premium for each policy period is printed on\nyour certificate of insurance.\nThe amount you pay also includes allowances for government\nfees, taxes and charges, including stamp duty and GST.\nFor new policies\nWe calculate your premium based on several factors. Some\nare pre-set and don\u2019t vary, e.g. amounts we consider for some\ninternal expenses. Others can affect the premium amount\ndepending on whether we believe it increases or decreases the\nrisk to us. For example, the type of cover and options you have\nselected.\nWe\u2019ll also take into account risk factors associated with you\nand your pet such as your pet\u2019s breed and age. For instance, as\nyour pet gets older the risk of your pet requiring treatment will\nincrease and so the premium increases.\nThere are also commercial factors that affect your premium,\nincluding costs associated with operating our business and our\ncommercial arrangements.\nYour premium calculation may also include discounts or\npromotional offers that we provide. If you qualify for two or more\ndiscounts, we apply a specific order to our calculation of your\nfinal premium.\nAlso, any discounts and/or your premium may be rounded up or\ndown and some may only apply in the first year of coverage.\nFor renewals and changes to your policy\nFor renewals, we also factor in the claim history for your pet and\nthe average cost of care for pets like yours, as well as the claims\nexperience across all our insured pets. Because of all of these\nfactors and the changes to your pet\u2019s risk profile, your premium\nwill increase from year to year.\nWhen calculating your premium on renewal, we also consider\nhow much your premium was previously, including any discounts\nthat may have been applied. This means that we may limit\nmovements up or down.\nThese same factors and others are also used to calculate your\npremium if you amend your coverage.\nFor information about how and when to pay your premium,\nplease read the \u201cPaying your premium\u201d section.\n38\nCooling off period\nYou have a 21 day period to ensure you\u2019re happy with every\naspect of your policy.\nDuring this time, you can contact us and cancel your policy.

This\nmeans that if a sub-limit applies for a particular item of\ncover, condition or treatment, we won\u2019t pay more than that\namount, either on an individual or per claim basis for that\nitem. This is also subject to the overall benefit limit or other\nrelevant sub-limit not having been exceeded.\n\u2022 The benefit limit and sub-limits are reset when you\nrenew your policy.

We\u2019ll then respond\nto you (and your vet if submitted on your behalf) in writing\nwith the outcome. A pre-approval isn\u2019t valid unless we\u2019ve\nagreed to it in writing.\nNote: If we agree to a pre-approval but the treatment\nprovided by your vet differs from the treatment request in\nthe pre-approval, then our assessment of the amount we\ncover under your claim may vary from the notified pre-\napproval amount. A variation in the amount we cover may\nalso occur if you have reached your benefit limit, sub-limit\nor other applicable limit on the claim.\nand calculates your pet insurance claim benefits while you\u2019re\nstill at the vet. If your vet is GapOnly\u00ae enabled, you don\u2019t\nneed to pay your vet in full prior to the submission of your\nclaim. Instead, your vet submits the claim to us electronically\non your behalf and you agree to pay the \u2018gap\u2019 (the difference\nbetween the vet\u2019s invoice and the claim benefit calculated, if\nany, under your policy).\nYou must pay the gap to your treating vet at the time you\nmake a GapOnly\u00ae claim. We\u2019ll then pay the claim benefit (if\nany) directly to your vet.\nYou can find more information on GapOnly\u00ae here: www.\ngaponly.com.au.\nGapOnly\u00ae claim, we\u2019ll pay the claim benefits to you, not your\nvet.\n25\nYou agree that we\u2019re authorised to discuss with your vet, the\ndetails relating to your claim or the treatment provided to\nyour pet in relation to a claim made under your policy.

We\u2019ll contact you or your\nvet if required;\n\u2022 there may be situations where we request additional\nveterinary history from current or previous vets, e.g. if\nthere\u2019s a large history gap, to ensure we have all relevant\nclinical information for your pet;\n\u2022 for adopted pets, veterinary history is only required from\nwhen you took ownership. You\u2019ll need to provide us with\nproof of adoption or transfer of ownership papers;\n\u2022 if you\u2019re making an emergency boarding claim, we may\nrequire supporting documentation;\n\u2022 unless we agree otherwise, all of your claims must\ninclude itemised tax invoice(s), payment receipt(s) and\nvet consultation notes if applicable;\n\u2022 incomplete claim forms may result in a processing\ndelay.

This advice provides\ndetails of your claim outcome and how your claim has been\nprocessed. For Hollard issued policies, all approved benefits\nwill be paid into your nominated bank account or by cheque.\nFor PetSure issued policies, we\u2019ll pay all approved benefits\ninto your nominated bank account.\nWe reserve the right to deduct from the benefit amount any\namount due to us, for example for any overdue premium\npayments.\nNote: In the event that we pay a benefit contrary to the\npolicy terms and conditions for whatever reason, this won\u2019t\nconstitute a waiver of our rights to apply the policy terms\nand conditions retrospectively to any paid claims or to any\nfuture claims for that or any related condition.\nWe also reserve our right to recover from you any benefit\namount received by you as a result of such error.\nDeclining to process your claim\nIf you or your vet refuse to or are unable to provide\ninformation reasonably requested by us to process your\nclaim, we may decline or reduce the amount payable for\nyour claim, in accordance with relevant law.\nFraudulent claims\nIf you submit a fraudulent claim or entice your vet to behave\nin a fraudulent manner regarding a claim, then the claim may\nbe denied or reduced in accordance with relevant law, and\nwe may cancel your policy altogether in the event you make\na fraudulent claim.

Total\nbenefits paid to you across all insurance cannot exceed your\nactual expenses.\nHow we prevent or handle fraud\nUnfortunately, fraud and attempted fraud can occur.

The amount you pay is shown on your certificate of\ninsurance. It includes all premium, administration fees and\nany applicable discounts, government taxes, fees and/or\ncharges.\nWe like to think we don\u2019t miss a thing, but if you have a\nquestion about anything on your certificate of insurance,\nplease contact us.\nHow to pay\nYour pet insurance premium is payable when you take out a\nnew policy and subsequently when your policy is renewed.\nPremiums can be paid via direct debit through a credit card\nor bank account:\n\u2022 annually;\nOR\n\u2022 in monthly or fortnightly instalments.\nWhen premiums are paid in monthly or fortnightly\ninstalments, you\u2019ll be charged a collection fee per instalment,\nthe amount of which will be displayed on your certificate of\ninsurance.\nIf we accept and pay a claim under your policy, we may\ndeduct the balance of any outstanding premium from the\nclaim payment.\nPaying on time\nYou need to make sure your premium payment(s) are up to\ndate.

It\u2019s also important\nto understand that, in answering the questions, you\u2019re\nanswering for yourself and anyone else to whom the\nquestions apply.\nIf any of our questions aren\u2019t clear and you need help, please\ncontact us.\nWhen this duty applies\nThe duty to take reasonable care not to make a\nmisrepresentation also applies before you renew, vary,\nextend or reinstate an existing contract of insurance. This\nmeans that you must inform us of any changes to the\ninformation set out in your certificate of insurance, where the\ninformation is no longer honest, accurate and complete. If\nyou don\u2019t contact us to update this information, we\u2019ll take it\nthat you agree that the information remains honest, accurate\nand complete. Please contact us if you have any doubts.\nIf you don\u2019t comply with your duty\nIf you don\u2019t take reasonable care in answering our questions\nor inform us of changes to the information set out in\nyour policy documents, you may breach your duty. If that\nhappens, your policy may be cancelled, or treated as if it\nnever existed, and any claim may be denied or not paid in\nfull.\nUpdates to the PDS\nWe may need to update this PDS from time to time when\ncertain changes occur and where we\u2019re required and\npermitted by law to do so. If that happens, we\u2019ll issue you\nwith a new PDS or a Supplementary PDS or other compliant\ndocument to update the relevant information.\nWhere the information isn\u2019t materially adverse from the\npoint of view of a reasonable person considering whether\nto buy or continue to hold this insurance, we may issue you\nwith notice in a different form, including but not limited to\ndisclosure updates on the PetSure and/or\nPetinsurance.com.au website(s).\nYou can contact us to get a free paper copy or download an\nelectronic copy that summarises these changes.\n37\nHow we calculate your premium\nYour premium is calculated when your Petinsurance.com.au\npolicy begins, at each policy anniversary, and also if you vary\nyour cover. The premium for each policy period is printed on\nyour certificate of insurance.\nThe amount you pay also includes allowances for\ngovernment fees, taxes and charges, including stamp duty\nand GST.\nFor new policies\nWe calculate your premium based on several factors. Some\nare pre-set and don\u2019t vary, e.g. amounts we consider for\nsome internal expenses. Others can affect the premium\namount depending on whether we believe it increases or\ndecreases the risk to us. For example, the type of cover and\noptions you have selected.\nWe\u2019ll also take into account risk factors associated with\nyou and your pet such as your pet\u2019s breed and age. For\ninstance, as your pet gets older the risk of your pet requiring\ntreatment will increase and so the premium increases.\nThere are also commercial factors that affect your premium,\nincluding costs associated with operating our business and\nour commercial arrangements.\nYour premium calculation may also include discounts or\npromotional offers that we provide. If you qualify for two or\nmore discounts, we apply a specific order to our calculation\nof your final premium.\nAlso, any discounts and/or your premium may be rounded\nup or down and some may only apply in the first year of\ncoverage.\nFor renewals and changes to your policy\nFor renewals, we also factor in the claim history for your pet\nand the average cost of care for pets like yours, as well as\nthe claims experience across all our insured pets. Because of\nall of these factors and the changes to your pet\u2019s risk profile,\nyour premium will increase from year to year.\nWhen calculating your premium on renewal, we also\nconsider how much your premium was previously, including\nany discounts that may have been applied. This means that\nwe may limit movements up or down.\n38\nThese same factors and others are also used to calculate\nyour premium if you amend your coverage.\nFor information about how and when to pay your premium,\nplease read the \u201cPaying your premium\u201d section.\nCooling off period\nYou have a 30 day period to ensure you\u2019re happy with every\naspect of your policy.\nDuring this time, you can contact us and cancel your policy.\nIf we receive your request to cancel your policy within the\n30 day period after the policy commencement date or\nrenewal date and as long as you\u2019ve not made a claim or\nintend to make a claim, we\u2019ll give you a refund of any monies\nreceived since that date. We may also deduct any taxes or\nduties that we\u2019re unable to refund.\nIf you\u2019ve made a claim during the cooling off period and\nwish to cancel your policy, then any refund will be in\naccordance with provisions set out in the \u201cCancellation by\nyou\u201d section.\nAfter the cooling off period ends, you\u2019ll still be able to cancel\nyour policy and you have rights upon cancellation in certain\ncircumstances under the policy.

Words that are italicised\nin this booklet have the special meaning explained in this\nsection.\nBenefit limit and Sub-limit(s) means as follows:\nBenefit limit means the applicable maximum amount\npayable by us in any one policy period, for your cover.\nSub-limit(s) means the applicable maximum amount(s)\npayable by us in any one policy period, for particular items,\ntreatments or conditions that you have cover for.\nThe amounts of your benefit limit and sub-limit(s), together\nwith particular items subject to sub-limit(s) are specified on\nyour certificate of insurance.\nAlso note:\n\u2022 we\u2019ll never pay more than the overall annual benefit limit\nor sub-limit specified on your certificate of insurance.\nThis means that if a sub-limit applies for a particular item\nof cover, condition or treatment, we won\u2019t pay more than\nthat amount, either on an individual or per claim basis for\nthat item. This is also subject to the overall benefit limit\nor other relevant sub-limit not having been exceeded.\n\u2022 the benefit limit and sub-limits are reset when you\nrenew your policy. This means that policy benefits don\u2019t\naccumulate across policy periods. They expire at the end\nof each policy period.\n\u2022 the benefit limit and sub-limits are also subject to the\nexcess (if any) applicable to your cover.\nBenefit percentage means the stated percentage of each\nclaim for eligible vet expenses and eligible costs for covered\nitems which we reimburse, subject to the applicable benefit\nlimit or sub-limit and excesses. The applicable benefit\npercentage will be shown on your certificate of insurance.\nNote: The benefit percentage does not apply to routine care\nitems.\n50\nBilateral condition means any condition affecting body parts\non each side of your pet\u2019s body, e.g. ears, eyes, knees or\nelbows.\nA bilateral condition is considered a single condition\nwhen applying a benefit limit, sub-limit, excess (if any) or\nexclusion.\nExample 1: if your pet had elbow dysplasia in the left elbow\nprior to the commencement date of the first policy period or\nduring the applicable waiting period, and this falls within the\ndefinition of a pre-existing condition, a subsequent elbow\ndysplasia in the right elbow will still be considered a pre-\nexisting condition.\nExample 2: if your pet suffers from a patella luxation in its\nleft hind leg and arthritis in its right hind leg, this is not a\nbilateral condition. Patella luxation and arthritis aren\u2019t the\nsame condition.\nCertificate of insurance is the certificate we provide you that\noutlines the key details of the contract of insurance between\nyou and us. It includes the policy number, cover, excess (if\nany), commencement date, end date, insured pet details, and\nthe schedule of benefits, including benefit limits, sub-limits\nand dental illness limit (if applicable).\nNote: A certificate of insurance is issued to you when we\naccept your application for cover, on each renewal, and\nwhenever your policy is amended.\nChronic condition means a long-lasting condition which\nis recurring or present in your pet over a period greater\nthan three months in total, however the three-month\nperiod need not be consecutive. Chronic conditions may\nalso be intermittent or managed with medication and/or\nprescription diets with intervals of remission.\nExamples include (but aren\u2019t limited to): chronic or\nseasonal allergies, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes,\nosteoarthritis, cancer and some autoimmune diseases.\nIf a chronic condition is a pre-existing condition, it will\nalways be excluded from cover. That means, it will never be\nconsidered a temporary condition.\n51\nCommencement date unless otherwise specified, is the date\nwhen cover for your pet started in the current policy period\nas shown on your certificate of insurance. The start time is\n11:59PM on that date.\nNote: Also see the first policy period definition for\ncommencement date of first policy period.\nCondition means any specified accidental injury, or any\nmanifestation of an illness. This also includes a specified\ndental condition, where covered under the dental illness\nbenefit.\nConsultation and other derivations means an examination\nperformed by or under the supervision of a vet, including\na physical consultation, inpatient examination, in-hospital\nexamination, health certificate, consultation or recheck\nconsultation/visit, referral/specialist consultation/visits,\nphone consultation, web consultation and emergency and\nafter-hours consultations/visits.\nNote: Any applicable sub-limit will be shown on your\ncertificate of insurance.\nCover means:\n\u2022 the benefit limit, sub-limits, excess (if any), benefit\npercentage and any other optional or additional benefits\n(including their limits) applicable to your selected policy;\nand\n\u2022 the cover applicable under your policy for your selected\nplan and any previous policies you\u2019ve held with us where\nthe same or a substantially similar or a higher level of\ncover was provided in the current policy period, without\nany break or time without holding the cover.\nNote: Your certificate of insurance tells you which plan\nyou have. The cover for your plan comprises of specified\naccidental injury cover, illness cover, additional benefits and\nany selected optional benefits.\nCruciate ligament condition means partial or complete\nrupture of the cruciate ligament(s).
